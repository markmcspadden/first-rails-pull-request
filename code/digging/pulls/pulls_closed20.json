In particular, we want to make sure that following is true:\r\n\r\nPost.references()     # => raises error\r\nPost.references([])   # => does not raise an error from check_empty_arguments\r\n\r\nAlso, modified my CHANGELOG entry (because it was actually incorrect and had an example of incorrect behavior). \r\n\r\nFinally, check_empty_arguments now takes in args, instead of *args, which makes it easier for a method to manipulate the args before they get sent on to check_empty_arguments. This just allows for easier use in the future. \r\n",

    "body": "1. When comparing the directory to delete against the top level\r\n   cache_path, use File.realpath to make sure we aren't comparing two\r\n   unequal strings that point to the same path. This occurs, for\r\n   example, when cache_path has a trailing slash, which it does in the\r\n   default Rails configuration. Since the input to\r\n   delete_empty_directories never has a trailing slash, the comparison\r\n   will never be true and the top level cache directory (and above) may\r\n   be deleted. However…\r\n\r\n2. File.delete raises EPERM when trying to delete a directory, so no\r\n   directories have ever been deleted. Changing the code to Dir.delete\r\n   fixes that.",

It seems like the best course of action is to throw an error when one attempts to touch a new object that has not yet been persisted. For instance: \r\n\r\nball = Ball.new\r\nball.touch :updated_at\r\n\r\nShould not trigger a DB statement at all, but should probably throw an error until the ball object has been persisted. This PR takes care of that (in the same manner that it is done for update_column) and adds a test.",

    "body": "Another \"get some feedback on this idea\" PR. Thanks @burtlo!\r\n\r\nIt's easy to forget what the order of things are in the routing table, especially if you're new. The HTML view has headings, but the console does not. They're a little different at the moment due to space, but I can change them to be as close to possible once we determine this is a good idea.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rake routes\r\n  Prefix Verb   URI Pattern              Controller#Action\r\n    foos GET    /foos(.:format)          foos#index\r\n         POST   /foos(.:format)          foos#create\r\n new_foo GET    /foos/new(.:format)      foos#new\r\nedit_foo GET    /foos/:id/edit(.:format) foos#edit\r\n     foo GET    /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#show\r\n         PATCH  /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#update\r\n         PUT    /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#update\r\n         DELETE /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#destroy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne other thing I'd like to implement, but haven't: test if we're running in a shell or not. If we're not, then we shouldn't print the headings. If you're writing scripts that rely on the output of the task, no headings is way better.",
