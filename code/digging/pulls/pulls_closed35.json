    "body": "When someone gets a routing exception, the routes are rendered (starting in Rails 4.0). This PR brings parity between the html routes in the `rails/info/routes` path and when rendered from an exception. This is the continuation of #8521 which brought html formatted routes to the info controller.\r\n\r\nIn addition to bringing parity to the two views, we're keeping our views DRY by rendering off of the same partials. In this case Railties depends on partials provided by ActionDispatch. I'm open to alternative implementations. Ideally both views will use the same code so any improvements or updates to it will be reproduced on both.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3O1D0K1v0j0i343O3T3T/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-17%20at%203.07.20%20PM.png)",
