    "body": "It was found that there were some good use cases where it was prudent to ````prevent_deliveries```` even if ````prevent_deliveries```` was globally set to true for e.g. you wish to not send emails to users who are unsubscribed or users who are blocked or unconfirmed. \n\nThere are other use cases as well, such as spam detection within the body should prevent delivery.\n\nThis currently requires a common pattern which goes something like this\n\n````ruby\nSomeMailer.someemail(user).deliver if user.sendable?\n````\nWith this change it can be written alternatively as \n\n````ruby\ndef somemail(user)\n  mail :to => user.email, :subject => ... , :perform_deliveries => user.sendable?\nend\nSomeMailer.somemail(user).deliver # expect no delivery if user was unsendable\n````\n\nThis allows for conditional deliveries based on user's own logic.\n\nThe way I've implemented this, ensures that if ````perform_deliveries```` is switched_off globally, then it cant be switched on by the mail message instance.\n\nAfter checking further it was found that ````perform_deliveries```` could be overridden in interceptors but at that stage you do not always have access to the underlying models used for decisions.\n\n/cc @schneems / @josevalim / @mikel",

    "body": "The Inflector is currently not very supportive of internationalized\nwebsites. If a user wants to singularize and/or pluralize words based on\nany locale other than English, they must define each case in locale\nfiles. Rather than create large locale files with mappings between\nsingular and plural words, why not allow the Inflector to accept a\nlocale?\n\nThis patch makes ActiveSupport::Inflector locale aware and uses the\napplication's `I18n.default_locale` unless otherwise specified. Users\nwill still be provided a list of English (:en) inflections, but they may\nadditionally define inflection rules for other locales. Each list is\nkept separately and permanently. There is no reason to limit users to\none list of inflections:\n\n```ruby\nActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:es) do |inflect|\n  inflect.plural(/$/, 's')\n  inflect.plural(/([^aeéiou])$/i, '\\1es')\n  inflect.plural(/([aeiou]s)$/i, '\\1')\n  inflect.plural(/z$/i, 'ces')\n  inflect.plural(/á([sn])$/i, 'a\\1es')\n  inflect.plural(/é([sn])$/i, 'e\\1es')\n  inflect.plural(/í([sn])$/i, 'i\\1es')\n  inflect.plural(/ó([sn])$/i, 'o\\1es')\n  inflect.plural(/ú([sn])$/i, 'u\\1es')\n\n  inflect.singular(/s$/, '')\n  inflect.singular(/es$/, '')\n\n  inflect.irregular('el', 'los')\nend\n\n'ley'.pluralize(:es)   # => \"leyes\"\n'ley'.pluralize(:en)   # => \"leys\"\n'avión'.pluralize(:es) # => \"aviones\"\n'avión'.pluralize(:en) # => \"avións\"\n```\n\nA multilingual Inflector should be of use to anybody that is tasked with\ninternationalizing their Rails application.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Celis <david@davidcelis.com>",

The `class_of_active_record_descendant` method was confusing because it required an argument, but that argument was 'self' and was not used outside this context.\n\nAlso moved base_class tests to inheritance_test.rb and added some test coverage for some untested cases.",

    "body": "Currently in Rails, it is not possible to specify a :layout when\ndirectly calling\nrender @variable\nMore specifically, the following code doesn't work:\n\nrender @variable, layout: 'different_layout'\n\nThis patch allows specifying a layout. To pass locals to the layout,\nomit the locals: {} brackets. Thus, instead of writing\n\nrender 'variables/variable', layout: 'different_layout', locals:\n{variable: @variable, some_local: 'foo'}\n\nyou can just write:\n\nrender @variable, layout: 'different_layout', some_local: 'foo'\n\nOne drawback is that a local may not be named \"layout\", else it won't\nwork. It is quite obvious though since locals are passed \"inline\"\n(without the locals: {} brackets).",
