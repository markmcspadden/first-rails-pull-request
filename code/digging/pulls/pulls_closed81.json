    "body": "I am running JRuby 1.6.7 (1.6.6 locally) on Glassfishv3, OpenJDK.  I am running a Rack\napplication that uses ActiveRecord 3.0.12 and/or 3.2.3.  Glassfish\nmaintains a thread pool which it uses to service HTTP requests in a\nmultithreaded fashion.  I am running into concurrency problems.\n\nI have created a small JRuby-only test script that, at least on my\nmachine, reliably triggers the error.  The script sets up active\nrecord and then in a thread pool with 32 threads acquires and releases\nconnections from the connection pool.\n\nWith activerecord 3.2.3 and master (2012-05-19) I see the following error:\n\n    Detected invalid hash contents due to unsynchronized modifications with concurrent users org/jruby/RubyHash.java:1356:in `keys'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:292:in `release'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:255:in `checkin'\n      /home/pat/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.6.6/lib/ruby/1.9/monitor.rb:201:in `mon_synchronize'\n      /home/pat/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.6.6/lib/ruby/1.9/monitor.rb:200:in `mon_synchronize'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:250:in `checkin'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:158:in `release_connection'\n      /home/pat/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.6.6/lib/ruby/1.9/monitor.rb:201:in `mon_synchronize'\n      /home/pat/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.6.6/lib/ruby/1.9/monitor.rb:200:in `mon_synchronize'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:156:in `release_connection'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:373:in `clear_active_connections!'\n      org/jruby/RubyHash.java:1229:in `each_value'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:373:in `clear_active_connections!'\n      /home/pat/dev/ruby/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_handling.rb:93:in `clear_active_connections!'\n      ar_test.rb:85:in `(root)'\n      org/jruby/RubyProc.java:258:in `call'\n\nAfter applying my patch, I do not get the concurrency error.

It prints\nany exceptions that are raised.  It runs for a long time, and may or\nmay not be able to reproduce the concurrency error, but on my system\nit does reproduce it reliably.  I'm not sure how to turn this script into a useful unit test,\nmostly since it needs to run for a \"long time\" to even trigger the bug.\nAny suggestions?\n\nExecuted like this:\n\n    bundle exec jruby --1.9 ar_test.rb\n\nThe Gemfile:\n\n    source 'http://rubygems.org'\n\n    gem 'activerecord-jdbch2-adapter'\n\n    gem 'activerecord', :path => '../rails/activerecord'\n    gem 'activesupport', :path => '../rails/activesupport'\n    gem 'activemodel', :path => '../rails/activemodel'\n    gem 'active_record_deprecated_finders', :path => '../active_record_deprecated_finders'\n\nThe script itself:\n\n    require 'java'\n\n    require 'active_record'\n    require 'thread'\n\n    config = {\n      'adapter' => 'jdbch2',\n      'database' => 'mem:db'\n    }\n\n    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(config)\n    ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!\n\n    executor = Java::java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(32)\n\n    task = proc do\n      t0 = Time.now\n      begin\n        ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.connection\n        sleep (rand(50) / 1000.0)\n        ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!\n      rescue => e\n        [Time.now - t0, e]\n      else\n        [Time.now, nil]\n      end\n    end\n\n    n = 100000\n    (1..n).map do\n      executor.submit(task)\n    end.map do |future|\n      time, err = future.get\n      if err\n        puts \"took #{time}s to acquire and release\"\n        puts \"#{err.message} #{err.backtrace.join(\"\\n\\t\")}\"\n      end\n    end\n\n    executor.shutdown\n\n",

The only tiny functionality change is a `===` vs `==` which I've annotated inline.\n\nI've symbolised the keys of the options hash and used `options.fetch(:foobar, x)` instead of `options[:foobar] ||= x` as per discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!topic/rubyonrails-core/jjIDHOhqT9E\n\nI'm happy to revert or change any bits that people don't like, but I'm also happy to implement the changes that people do like more widely, just to try and standardise the style as much as possible. It just takes less brain cycles if the code all looks the same.\n\nI hope it's helpful.",

Unfortunately, when running tests, many things can (and\nshould) happen within a single second and precision of a full second\nisn't enough. Milliseconds may be good here, but with fast-enough\nCPUs, a single test example may execute within that one-millisecond\nboundary, which may include multiple calls.\n\nMore importantly, in a production environment, precision of one second can\nbe far too much for cache invalidation (`AR::Base#cache_key` uses\n`Time#to_s(:numeric)`), as when two clients update the same record\nsimultaneously, the first update will be cached. Since the second update\nassigns the same value to `updated_at`, the first cached value is not\ninvalidated unless done so manually.",

The functionality then breaks after the first call to `url_for`.\n\n# Resolution:\n\nThe route-set does not directly manipulate the string passed into `#url_for`.\nIt creates a copy without the leading slash if necessary.",
