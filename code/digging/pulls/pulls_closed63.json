    "body": "attr_accessible is a very confusing name. \n\nFirst, it has nothing to do with the other attr_* macros, which deal with Ruby instance-variable-based getters and setters, not Rails attributes. \n\nSecond, the term \"access\" is generally understood to refer to reading a value, viz. accessor vs. mutator. Yet this macro is about the *opposite* of reading; instead, it determines whether an attribute can be *written*, aka assigned.\n\nThird, this is in a module called Mass Assignment, and this macro is literally specifying which values can be mass assigned. So why be so mysterious? Let's just call it mass_assignable and get on with our lives. It will make this feature more understandable to every Rails programmer who has had to figure out what that line is doing there, especially now that it's in every generated model class -- and rightly so, since it's an important and useful feature and deserves to be embraced and understood by all.\n\nThis patch is just to show the (trivial) implementation; changes to documentation and to the generators will follow if people agree it's worth doing.\n",

    "body": "Rails included a single character response body to work around an old Safari bug where headers were ignored if no content was sent.\n\nThis patch brings the behavior slightly closer to spec if :no_content/204 is explicity requested via a head only response by sending a no content in the response body. \n\nThe single character body breaks especially JSON parsers on iOS etc that sees it as invalid content. By localising the change to only 204 responses this should allow API implementers to use the 204 status code when no content is sent back.",

If a key is left off like this:\n\n    <%= link_to 'user', user_path %>\n\nAn error will be raised like this:\n\n    No route matches {:action=>\"show\", :controller=>\"users\"}\n\nSince Journey know's that the `:id` is missing, we can add extra debugging information to the error message.\n\n    No route matches {:action=>\"show\", :controller=>\"users\"} missing required keys: [:id]\n\n\nThis will help new and seasoned developers look closer at their parameters. I've also subclassed the routing error to be clear that this error is a result of attempting to generate a url and not because the user is trying to visit a bad url. \n\nThe current error message is misleading and confuses most developers. The important part isn't what's in the options, the important part is that we are missing keys. Adding this information to the error message will make debugging much more obvious. \n\nThis is the sister pull request of https://github.com/rails/journey/pull/44 which will be required to get they missing keys into the correct error message. Opening both issues at the same time to start a dialog. \n\nExample Development Error in Rails: http://cl.ly/image/3S0T0n1T3421\n\ncc/ @pixeltrix",

    "body": "Today, eager loading an application is coupled with the config.cache_classes configuration. This means that every time we cache classes, we eager load the app. This is not necessarily true, for example in test environment an application could benefit of not eager loading the whole application when running a single test file, [as the results reported here](https://gist.github.com/2947894).\n\nThis proposal discuss some changes for Rails 4 to make booting more flexible and consistent.\n\n## config.eager_load\n\nThe first part of the proposal is to add a config.eager_load that says when to eager load the application. By default, we want these settings to be:\n\n    # development\n    config.cache_classes = false\n    config.eager_load = false\n\n    # test\n    config.cache_classes = true\n    config.eager_load = false # you may want to turn this to true if using spork\n\n    # production\n    config.cache_classes = true\n    config.eager_load = true\n\nNotice that running a rake task **always** disables eager load (this is hardcoded in rails source today).\n\n## config.eager_load_namespaces\n\nRails also has a boolean configuration named `config.preload_frameworks` that preloads frameworks. I don't like this configuration because it is very tied to Rails and its frameworks. I propose instead `config.eager_load_namespaces` as a configuration generic enough not only to support Rails frameworks, but any gem or extension. We should be able to eager load any namespace by adding it to the list:\n\n    config.eager_load_namespaces << DataMapper\n\nAnd now, whenever `config.eager_load` is true, we will invoke `DataMapper.eager_load!` to do the proper setup.\n\nThe idea of registering namespaces (and not lambdas) is that a user should be able to remove a namespace of the list if it is causing problems (or if they don't really need to eager load it).\n\nAnother nice thing about this approach is that all engines (and therefore any Rails application) already implements the `eager_load!` method, so they could be added by default to the `config.eager_load_namespaces` array, unifying both preload frameworks and eager load approaches.\n\n**NOTE**: We are pending some hax to ensure production still work with webrick. At the worst scenario, bring the Rack::Lock option back.",

See: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0e1e527654f286452fa6f86f5d229f278435319a\n\nHowever, the same commit raises an explicit error if the password_digest is blank even if validations are disabled. I have altered this behavior to raise the error only if validations are enabled.\n\nAn example where the existing version is undesirable is if a user account model is created after an oauth sign in. In that case, a user may be created from Twitter/Facebook/Google/etc. credentials without ever creating a password. I believe this use case should work by default and not require catching an exception.",
