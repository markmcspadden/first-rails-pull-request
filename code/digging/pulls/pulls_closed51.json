    "body": "One of the greatest things about rails is that it is so standards-compliant,\r\nno other framework that I have seen have complied to the\r\nHTTP standard (think REST) in such a degree that Rails does. Kudos to\r\nyou all for that.\r\n\r\nI think we (Rails community) should follow the line of standards\r\ncompliance and also\r\ntake it to the binary prefixes [1], i.e. kilobytes, megabytes,\r\netc. For more than half a decade SI units has been a standard\r\n(occupying the prefixes kilo, mega, ...) Since the introduction of\r\ncomputers the prefixes has been misused in the IT industry for powers\r\nof 1024 but used correctly (for marketing reasons) by storage\r\nmanufacturers to mean powers of 1000.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 IEC published the new standard for powers of 1024 (known as\r\nbinary prefixes[1]). In 2008 this was harmonized with ISO standard in\r\nISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2008\r\n\r\nI think it is a good time (for Rails 4) for Rails to conform to these\r\nstandards. That means that every time a power of 1024 is used the IEC\r\nprefixes kibi, mebi, and so on are used and vice versa. Further every\r\ntime a power of 1000 is used the SI prefixes are used, that is, kilo,\r\nmega, and so on and vice versa.\r\n\r\nI have created a pull request\r\n(https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7819) that implements two things\r\n(in two separate commits):\r\n\r\n1) Rename all use of 1024 to use IEC prefix names\r\n\r\n   a) Rename of core extension: 2.kilobytes => 2.kibibyte  == 2*1024\r\n   b) Rename all use of these helpers within the Rails project.\r\n   c) Ensure that number the prefixes are KiB, MiB when dividing by\r\n   powers of 1024, and using KB, MB when dividing by powers of 1000\r\n   (that is when options[:prefix] => :si)\r\n\r\n2) (Re)Introduced the posibility to use SI prefix names (meaning powers of 1000)\r\n   Introduced SI prefix helpers 2.kilobytes == 2*1000\r\n\r\nImpact on Rails itself:\r\nNone: All the useages has been renamed to use the semantically\r\nequivalent method (that is IEC names).\r\n\r\nImpact on Rails projects:\r\nThe use of core extensions 2.kilobytes, 2.megabytes will mean\r\nsomething else; A power of 1000 in Rails4 as opposed to a power of\r\n1024 in Rails3. But the old behaviour can still be achieved by using\r\nIEC names instead such as 2.kibibytes or 2.mebibytes.\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n[1]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix",

    "body": "The show exception middleware allows developers to use custom error rendering apps. As error rendering applications become more complicated the chance for errors in the error rendering applications increases. By allowing multiple exception apps to be used instead of just one, a developer can provide a fallback application. This provides a better experience for the end user and decreases the chances that the `FAILSAFE_RESPONSE` will be used.\r\n\r\nBy default the public exception app will be put after any applications specified using `config.exceptions_app` in rails. This will provide a fallback in case an error is introduced by the exceptions_app.\r\n\r\nErrors from within exception_apps will still be shown in the logs for debugging. This was inspired by the desire to have safer dynamic error pages #7772 but with or without that PR, I believe this PR still provides valuable behavior. \r\n\r\nATP Railties and Action Pack.
