It appears that singularize and pluralize are supposed to be idempotent - i.e. when you call singularize or pluralize multiple times on the same string, you should get the same result. (At least for the \"officially supported\" cases that the stock inflector is designed to handle.) #4719 added the missing tests for regular cases, and this commit added the missing tests for the irregularities.\n\nWhile I'm at that, I also synced up the irregularity test cases with the current set of irregularity cases that we ship out-of-the-box.",

    "body": "Currently, ActiveSupport's ```class_attribute``` method allows for specification of class-level attributes that also propagate down to instances of a given class. However, when there is no value explicitly defined, methods defined by ```class_attribute``` return nil. In most circumstances this is okay, however, if you're implementing a pseudo-abstract class, it is probably better to raise a NotImplementedError than return nil if this method gets called on the abstract class.\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior is as follows:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Foo\r\n  class_attribute :bar\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Baz < Foo\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Qux < Foo\r\n  self.bar = 'quux'\r\nend\r\n\r\nputs Foo.bar.inspect #=> nil\r\nputs Baz.bar.inspect #=> nil\r\nputs Qux.bar.inspect #=> \"quux\"\r\nputs Foo.new.bar.inspect #=> nil\r\nputs Baz.new.bar.inspect #=> nil\r\nputs Qux.new.bar.inspect #=> \"quux\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose that the following behavior be supported:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Foo\r\n  class_attribute :bar, :default => lambda do |attribute|\r\n    raise NotImplementedError.new(\"#{attribute} is undefined\")\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Baz < Foo\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Qux < Foo\r\n  self.bar = 'quux'\r\nend\r\n\r\nputs Foo.bar.inspect # raises error\r\nputs Baz.bar.inspect # raises error\r\nputs Qux.bar.inspect #=> \"quux\"\r\nputs Foo.new.bar.inspect #=> raises error\r\nputs Baz.new.bar.inspect #=> raises error\r\nputs Qux.new.bar.inspect #=> \"quux\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy allowing ```class_attribute``` to take a default lambda (and perhaps a raw value), classes can cleanly implement abstract values in a generic fashion. Of course, if ```:default``` isn't provided, the behavior would not change; thus, backward compatibility would be ensured.",

    "body": "### Scenario\n\nA developer added a before_filter that did: `response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-transform'` in order to avoid mobile carriers from making invalid modifications to content.\n\n### Issues\n\nexpires_* calls were no longer applied (see commit details), and as such, Rack::Cache begun caching all mobile renders.\n\n### Arguments\n\nIt may be considered that setting only \"no-transform\" should result in the above behavior. I would stand by this view point, to a large extent, but many developers find these areas confusing. During investigating the root causes, additional bugs or at least vague semantics were found that were also addressed. It can be argued that the commit aligns a little better with the documentation, and applies some notion of POLS, whereby Rails calls / data structures are authoritative. An alternative POLS for many developers may be that the \"last modification to Cache-Control should win\", in which case this is still a violation if the header is modified after expires_in in a conflicting way.\n\n### Extended commit message:\n\nThere are several aspects to this commit, that don't well fit into broken down\ncommits, so they are detailed here:\n\n * When a user uses response.headers['Cache-Control'] = some_value, then the\n   documented convention in ConditionalGet is not adhered to, in this case,\n   response.cache_control is ignored due to `return if\n   self[CACHE_CONTROL].present?`\n * When a middleware sets cache-control headers that would clobber, they're\n   converted to symbols directly, without underscores. This would lead to bugs.\n * Items that would live in :extras if set through expires_in, are placed\n   directly in the @cache_control hash, and not respected in many cases\n   (somewhat adhering to the aforementioned documentation).\n * Although quite useless, any directive named 'extras' would be ignored.\n\nThe general convention applied is that `expires_*` take precedence, but no longer\noverwrite everything and `expires_*` are ALWAYS applied, even if the header is\nset.\n\nI am still unhappy about the contents of this commit, and the code in general.\nIdeally it should be refactored to no longer use :extras. I'd likely recommend\nexpanding @cache_control into a class, and giving it the power to handle the\nmerge in a more efficient fashion. Such a commit would be a larger change that\ncould have additional semantic changes for other libraries unless they utilize\nexpires_in in very standard ways.",

    "body": "Example: let's say that we need to apply two migration on production. First one delete unused column A. Second one does complicated data migration that failed during migration. In this case source code will be rollback to previous working version, but only the last migration got reverted. Production will run previous working version of source code that expects column A to exists, but it is not.\n\nThe thing that ActiveRecord::Migrator rollbacks only last applied migration will create inconsistency between data and code. It could be sensitive in some cases in production mode.\n\nThis patch applies all migrations under same ddl transaction if it is supported by database, so that Database state and source code are always consistent.",
