    "body": "Objects which `include Enumerable` already get the `as_json` method, but they do not get `to_json`.\r\n\r\nThat means it would get `to_json` from `Object` in most cases, however, not if they inherit from `BasicObject`.\r\n\r\nYou might think, \"who does that?!\" :confused: (and rightfully so). \r\n\r\nThat is just the simplest case where we'd have an issue. For a real-life use case, consider someone who uses `SimpleDelegator` and includes `Enumerable`. In that case, `#to_json` will forward on to the wrapped object, which means it will end up calling `#as_json` on each element in the wrapped collection, instead of each element in the collection we actually want to call it on.\r\n\r\nDelegation is a much more common pattern than inheriting directly from `BasicObject` and [we ran into this issue in DisplayCase](https://github.com/objects-on-rails/display-case/issues/27).\r\n\r\nNow, it could be the case that we should just say, \"if you don't want to forward the `#to_json` message to the other object, then write a method to define it.\"\r\n\r\nI thought about that a lot, but since `as_json` is already on `Enumerable` I thought `#to_json` probably should be as well. (Especially since there was already a test case for it, but it was not testing against a custom `Enumerable`, it was testing against an array of hashes).\r\n\r\n(And we certainly don't want to pollute `BasicObject` with the method, even though it is the simplest test case I could come up with!)\r\n\r\nIn addition to testing the case I mentioned above, this pull request also adds tests to demonstrate:\r\n\r\n1. The classes to which Rails adds `#to_json` get the method. (On the face of it, I thought that's really not testing much, but it could be useful to catch regressions for objects that expect it to be defined).\r\n2. That we actually test (to|as)_json against an enumerable instead of a hash.\r\n\r\n:thumbsup: ?",

    "body": "ActiveRecord allows us to specify custom primary keys, but does not properly accept them for nested attributes.\r\n\r\nFor example, with the models:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Deck < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :cards, autosave: true\r\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :cards, allow_destroy: true\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Card < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.primary_key = \"uuid\"\r\n  belongs_to :deck\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe primary key stored in the database (and presumably other related applications) as `uuid`, and the object is serialized as such:\r\n```ruby\r\nmy_deck.cards.inspect\r\n# => [{\"uuid\":\"abcd\",\"content\":\"Hello\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.623Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.679Z\"},{\"uuid\":\"efgh\",\"content\":\"World!\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.626Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.681Z\"}]\r\n\r\nmy_deck.cards.to_json\r\n#=> [{\"uuid\":\"abcd\",\"content\":\"Hello\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.623Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.679Z\"},{\"uuid\":\"efgh\",\"content\":\"World!\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.626Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.681Z\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a new instance of the model itself:\r\n```ruby\r\nmy_deck.cards.create(uuid:\"abcdefg\", content: \"Sup?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, using the correct primary key in an update to nested attributes will fail in multiple ways:\r\n```ruby\r\n# Can't destroy nested objects\r\nmy_deck.update([{uuid:\"abcd\",content:\"Hello\", _destroy: true}},\r\n                {uuid:\"efgh\",content:\"World!\", _destroy: true}])\r\nmy_deck.cards.inspect\r\n#=> [{\"uuid\":\"abcd\",\"content\":\"Hello\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.623Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.679Z\"},{\"uuid\":\"efgh\",\"content\":\"World!\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.626Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.681Z\"}]\r\n\r\n# Attempting to modify an object creates a new one,\r\n# with the same primary key value (which will fail)\r\nmy_deck.update([{uuid:\"abcd\",content:\"Something\"}},\r\n                {uuid:\"efgh\",content:\"Else!\"}])\r\n#=> Throws ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique error\r\n```\r\nInstead, we currently need to set up a hash like so:\r\n```ruby\r\nmy_deck.update([{id:\"abcd\",content:\"All alone :(\"}},\r\n                {id:\"efgh\",content:\"Else!\", _destroy: true}])\r\nmy_deck.cards.inspect\r\n#=> [{\"uuid\":\"abcd\",\"content\":\"All alone :(\",\"deck_id\":14,\"created_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.623Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2013-04-17T22:05:09.679Z\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nForcing the use of the arbitrary key `id` doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, and it forces anything interacting with Rails (and sometimes even Rails itself) to specially modify the object hash to use an otherwise unknown key.\r\n\r\nThe only tests that I needed to modify were two that specifically deal with custom primary keys in nested attributes (as these were verifying the old behavior), and all other tests pass.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any issues or if you think there is a better way to go about this.",

I added that when one of those arguments is a Hash, the key would be understood as the name of a table and each of its values as fields of said table.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nUser.joins(:posts).select(:name, posts: [:id, :title, :body])\r\n#   => SELECT name, posts.id, posts.title, posts.body FROM \"users\" INNER JOIN \"posts\" ON \"posts\".\"user_id\" = \"users\".\"id\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know how can I help you to get this merged.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

If something like `first, second` is a valid `schema_search_path` of course I'd have to adjust the patch to create two schemas.",
