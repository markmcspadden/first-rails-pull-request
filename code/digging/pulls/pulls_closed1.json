    "body": "**TL;DR: Maybe-negligible regression in exchange for reduced complexity and three-order-of-magnitude performance improvement to a method.**\r\n\r\nThis couldn't be done when the code was written initially because Rails couldn't rely on the presence of these encoding methods without introducing a dependency on 1.9+.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this proposed version is identical to the current version in any case where a string has an internally-consistent encoding.\r\n\r\nIt differs where:\r\n\r\n1. A string is not a valid UTF-8 string (because it contains at least one ISO-8859-1/CP1252 byte); and\r\n2. The string also contains at least one UTF-8 multibyte character.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the UTF-8 characters will be reinterpreted as CP1252 bytes. This is in contrast to the current strategy which attempts to resolve a mish-mash of the two disparate encodings. This is demonstrated in the three commented-out tests in the diff.\r\n\r\nI normally wouldn't propose something like this, but this is a particularly slow method, and letting ruby handle it natively actually cuts 99.7% off of its runtime. It is my experience that the case this regresses on is very unusual, but I may be wrong on this.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

There seems to be a missing argument in the call to ActionView::LookupContext which causes formats of templates to be ignored.\r\n\r\n@dhh asked me to do a PR of this for rails too. I followed the contributing guide to the best of my abilities. Please let me know if I should improve the PR in some way.\r\n\r\n",
