I would really enjoy getting comments on this PR.\r\n\r\nThanks lovely community.",

    "body": "Follow up #7923. Theres a couple things happening here.\r\n\r\n**asset_path, asset_url**\r\n\r\nOriginally inspired the [current sprockets rails plugin](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/master/lib/sprockets/rails/helpers/rails_helper.rb#L55-60), bd38d9f2118b1005718f8db4292b21a73879409e adds general purpose `asset_path` and `asset_url` helpers. All the other helpers simply funnel through this main point. Makes it possible for extensions to change the behavior of all the helpers w/o redefining each.\r\n\r\n**Remove AssetPaths**\r\n\r\nThere doesn't not a whole lot of documentation indicating that this class was ever okay to use publicly. And theres no tests asserting it either. Just :fire:ing it.\r\n\r\nThe core of it is replaced by inline helper methods, `compute_asset_path` and `compute_asset_host`. Both these methods should now be considered public. Apps or plugins can call them directly or override them to change there behavior.\r\n\r\n**Isolate old asset id code**\r\n\r\nI've move all the old asset id mtime query stuff into a separate module, `AssetIdHelper`. It uses the now `compute_asset_path` to set itself up.\r\n\r\nSince this is now modular, it wouldn't be a bad time to kill it or move it out into an optional plugin. I'd like to get @dhh's take on this.\r\n\r\n* :fire: it\r\n* extract it into a plugin\r\n* or just leave it as is\r\n\r\n**Bonus**\r\n\r\nYou should be able to include `ActionView::Helpers::AssetUrlHelper` into `AC::Base` just fine now.\r\n\r\n/cc @dhh @steveklabnik @guilleiguaran @rafaelfranca\r\n",
