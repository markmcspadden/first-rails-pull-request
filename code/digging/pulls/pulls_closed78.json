    "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm interested in using the ActiveSupport::Testing::Performance module and was surprised to see that it requires and calls code from ActionView.  I'd like to use this module in a context without ActionView, and now that we've moved NumberHelpers to ActiveSupport (https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315), we can do this.\n\nIn this pull request I'm changing ActiveSupport::Testing::Performance to use ActiveSupport::NumberHelper instead of ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper.  Also, to my knowledge this logic was untested, so I have added tests for the formatting logic (which pass before and after the code change).\n\nAny and all feedback is welcome.\n\nThanks!\n-Andrew.\n",

    "body": "Neither Test::Unit nor MiniTest rescue exceptions like Interrupt or\nNoMemoryError, but ActiveSupport::Testing::SetupAndTeardown#run which\noverrides MiniTest::Unit::TestCase#run currently rescues them.\n\nRescuing an Interrupt exception is annoying, because it means when you\nare running a lot of tests e.g. when running one of the rake test tasks,\nyou cannot break out using ctrl-C.\n\nRescuing exceptions like NoMemoryError is foolish, because the most\nsensible thing to happen is for the process to terminate as soon as\npossible.\n\nThis solution probably needs some finessing e.g. I'm not clear whether\nthe assumption is that only MiniTest is supported. Also early versions\nof MiniTest did not have this behaviour. Finally\nActiveSupport::Testing::Performance also suffers from the same\nproblem, but I have not fixed it here.\n\nIntegrating with Test::Unit & MiniTest has always been a pain. It would\nbe great if both of them provided sensible extension points for the kind\nof things that both Rails and Mocha want to do, but in the meantime\nhopefully this is of some help.",

Also, if the database is modified via SQL or a method that is a fancy wrapper for SQL (like increment_counter), it is the developer's responsibility to re-synchronize the models. I believe that this is an acceptable approach and it is one that is commonly implemented by other ORMs such as Hibernate.",

In modern rubies, it will invoke `phase()` but looking at the docs for older rubies I couldn't find a satisfactory alternative, and had to settle for slicing the first char off of `to_s()`.

    "body": "At 1bd4d1c67459a91415ee73a8f55d2309c0d62a87 was added Range#sum\noptimized version for arithmetic progressions. This improvment injected\na defect with not integer range boundaries. The defect was fixed by\ne0adfa82c05f9c975005f102b4bcaebfcd17d241. The second commit really\ndisabled optimization at all because in Ruby integer-valued numbers are\ninstances of Fixnum and Bignum classes. We should #use is_a?\n(#kind_of?) method instead #instance_of? to check if value is numerical:\n\n    1.class                 # => Fixnum\n    1.instance_of?(Integer) # => false\n    1.is_a?(Integer)        # => true\n\n    -100_000_000_000.class                 # => Bignum\n    -100_000_000_000.instance_of?(Integer) # => false\n    -100_000_000_000.is_a?(Integer)        # => true\n\nMoreover original implementation of Range#sum has a defect with reverse\nrange boundaries. If the first boundary is less than the second range is\nempty. Current commit fixes and tests this case too.",
