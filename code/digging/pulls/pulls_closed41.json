    "body": "The \"Active Record Validations and Callbacks\" guide section 9.3 \"Customizing the Error Messages HTML\" seems to indicate that\n\n````ruby\nActionView::Base.field_error_proc = Proc.new do |html_tag, instance|\n  errors = Array(instance.error_message).join(',')\n  %(#{html_tag}<span class=\"validation-error\">&nbsp;#{errors}</span>).html_safe\nend\n```` \n\nMight be a suitable option to customizing a field with error. But in the most common case this would wrap around the ````label```` as well as inputs like ````text_field```` helpers, leading to the error beings displayed twice.\n\nThe suggested fix to the guide ensures that the error is not displayed in case of labels. I'm sorry, but I just cooked up the fix in a couple of minutes so feel free if you think the solution could be better.\n\n\n",

    "body": "TL;DR similar to accepted pull request #6328, but this time targeting text columns\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6238\n\nThe long story: PostgreSQL doesn't take a limit for \"text\" columns so developers must choose between removing :limit from their binary column definitions, and not being able to target pgsql.\n\nThis change drops :limit specifications, when migrations are applied against a pgsql database. It's not ideal, because the limit information is lost. However, the mysql adapters do something similar, so I hope the approach is OK.\n\nA better long-term solution might be to map :text columns without :limit to \"text\", and :text columns with :limit to \"character varying(xxx)\". However, that requires changes in the code that maps postgresql types back into Rails types, and this change seems like a smaller step in the same direction.\n\nTesting: I added a table to postgresql_specific_schema that uses :limit on :text and :binary columns. Setting up this table fails without the patch in this pull request. I also added a couple of unit tests to a new sql_types_test file, which follows the convention in the MySQL adapter tests.\n\nPlease let me know if this patch needs more work, and thank you very much for Rails!",

Please check the discussion there for more background.\n\nThe idea was to raise an exception if a block is given, but since `sum` currently accepts a block, changing it to an exception doesn't sound good, so it's better to first deprecate, then changing later to an exception is that's the case.\n\nThere's an additional but related commit in this pull request, 2382e51145c4306a3fb1e85145da08b2990653ed, that removes the `sum` method from the `CollectionAssociation`, since it's already being delegated to the scope after edd94cee9af1688dd036fc58fd405adb30a5e0da, that method is never called. Please check the commit message for more info.\n\nI wanted to get more feedback on this one before applying it, so any feedback is welcome.\n\n/cc @adzap @jonleighton @josevalim @rafaelfranca ",

Each PR can be accepted/rejected independently. I hope all three can be accepted as they nicely complement each other and give powerful means to create reversible migrations. The ChangeLog remains to be updated, but I'll wait until confirmation that this will be merged.\n\nThanks\n",
