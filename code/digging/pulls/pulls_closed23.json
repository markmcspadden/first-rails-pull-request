    "body": "In testing the new cache_digest functionality of Rails 4 I ran across something that might not be a bug, but to me is unexpected behavior. Assume we have a model named Person that belongs to car with the touch functionality enabled.\r\n\r\n    car_1 = Car.create\r\n    car_2 = Car.create\r\n\r\n    person = Person.create :car_id => car_1.id\r\n\r\nAt this point car_1 gets touched as expected.\r\n\r\n    person.car = car_2\r\n    person.save\r\n\r\nAt this point car_2 gets touched as expected, but car_1 is not touched. This leads to a situation where car_1's cache will not be busted. I submit that it should.\r\n\r\nBasically when an object that belongs_to another object had a previous relationship. I think both should be touched.\r\n\r\nI don't mind writing the code for this behavior, but I wanted to get some feedback from everyone else to see if there was a reason this wasn't ever implemented, or something i'm not thinking of.\r\n\r\nThanks",
