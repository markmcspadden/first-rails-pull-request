They're 75 miles apart but different.\r\n\r\nIt's especially important because at the end of 2011 Samoa (and also Tokelau) jumped across the international dateline to be on the same day as New Zealand and Australia. They switched to UTC+13 and left American Samoa at UTC-11.\r\n\r\nDocumentation about the dateline change is at IANA in the file 'austalasia'.\r\n\r\nPacific/Fakaofo and Pacific/Apia are in TZInfo and present in ruby 1.9.3.
