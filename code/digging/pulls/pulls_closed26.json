    "body": "When debugging routes it can sometimes be difficult to understand exactly how the paths are matched. This PR adds a JS based path matching widget to the `/rails/info/routes` output. You can enter in a path, and it will tell you which of the routes that path matches, while preserving order (top match wins).\r\n\r\nThe matching widget in action:\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3A2F0v2m3m1Z1p3P3O3k/path-match.gif)\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR the only way to check matching paths is via mental math, or typing in a path in the url bar and seeing where it goes. This feature will be an invaluable debugging tool by dramatically decreasing the time needed to check a path match. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo newcomers: you can run this route page in Rails 3.2 (without this feature), using [Sextant](https://github.com/schneems/sextant). \r\n\r\nIt has also been noted that this PR is: **[OVER 9000](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik)**. \r\n\r\nATP actionpack",

This change fixes the\r\ntest and also resolves the original issue I encountered.\r\n\r\nThe original issue was failing integration tests (under ruby 1.8) due to\r\na stray new line being added to the cookie string. This in turn resulted\r\nin an empty string being included in the cookies array when it was split\r\nin [ActionController::Integration::Session](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/integration.rb#L328).\r\n\r\nFor example a the cookie string would go from:\r\n\r\n    cookie1=aaa\\ncookie2=bbb\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n    cookie1=aaa\\n\\ncookie2=bbb\r\n\r\nresulting in `cookies` being set to `[\"cookie1=aaa\", \"\", \"cookie2=bbb\"]`\r\nin Integration::Session, which would subsequently cause an exception to\r\nbe raised when the empty [string was split on line 330](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/integration.rb#L330).\r\n\r\nThe stray new line is introduced by convert_cookies! in\r\nActionController::Response. The use of Kernel#Array in ruby 1.8 was\r\nsplitting the string on new lines but does not consume the new line, so\r\nwhen the array is eventually joined back into a string extra new lines\r\nare present.\r\n\r\nIn ruby 1.9 Kernel#Array no longer splits, thus the test failed because\r\nit was expecting multiple cookies but only getting one.",
