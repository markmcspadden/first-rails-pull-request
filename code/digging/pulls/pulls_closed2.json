The reason they are duplicates is historical: the options that these two tests were supposed to check were deprecated, and the person who deprecated these options forgot to remove the test.\r\n\r\nThe ``use_full_path`` option was removed in 3b3790a which stops ``test_render_file_not_using_full_path`` from being useful. Also, passing the template handler to render was deprecated in 43d27e9, which stops ``test_render_file_without_specific_extension`` from being useful.",

    "body": "In the fixture builder there was a single statement that inserts the fixture row and yields something like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name (\"arr_column\") VALUES ('{\"asdf\", \"as'df\"}')\r\n\r\nThe problem with this was that the single quote in the second array value needs to be escaped.  Normally they won't need to be escaped in strings, but when array columns go all the way to sql (instead of binding to the connection) they get wrapped in '{ and }' and that makes escaping them required.\r\n\r\nThis fix causes the insert to look more like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name(\"arr_column\") VALUES( $1 ) [ [\"arr_column\", [\"asdf\", \"as''df\"] ] ]\r\n\r\nThe extra single quote (') character is the escape for a single quote in a string. \r\n\r\nI made a test for this, to run the test:\r\n\r\n    cd activerecord && ARCONN=postgresql ruby -Itest test/cases/adapters/postgresql/array_test.rb -n test_insert_fixture\r\n\r\nTo see the test fail revert the change at https://github.com/cconstantine/rails/commit/0e34a7efa6992e6771d34dc8163b79dd7df52667#L0R35\r\n\r\nThis change is only in postgresql code, and everything passes when I run \r\n\r\n    ARCONN=postgresql rake test_postgresql\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to the failed attempt to fix https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10043 .",

This is because the command that checks to see if the Rake tasks are performing tests are only defined there.\r\n\r\nI've moved the code that checks for whether rake is running tests into the rails.rb file.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm stumped as to how to write a test for this.
