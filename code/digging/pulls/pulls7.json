    "body": "This change adds a pessimistic lock attempt before calling destroy callbacks on an ActiveRecord model. This is a work around for a race condition where a record is destroyed by concurrent processes. The record will only be deleted once, but the callbacks based on that deletion will be called multiple times. This can mess up logic like the association counter cache which is invoked by a callback.\r\n\r\nThe change adds a select call with lock => true before destroying so the database can lock the record (if it supports this mechanism). If the record no longer exists, then the callbacks are not called. The rest of the destroy chain is called so that the record will remain in a consistent state.",

Ideally if you aliased an attribute all the AR methods should be able to resolve the real column name automatically, just like if you have set `self.table_name = ...` then all of AR (associations, etc) will be made aware of that and do the right thing.\r\n\r\nThis commit added support for aliased attributes in the finders, calculation methods, counting and pluck. This doesn't cover everything, but I believe it's a step in the right direction, and fixed this in places where it matters the most (finders).\r\n\r\n@jonleighton and @rafaelfranca can you take a look?

    "body": "This is a draft of a fix for #7809 - there's still one failing test, but I'm not certain how to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe failing test verifies that only a single query is executed when updating a record with autosave on its assocations. Adding `:inverse_of` causes the related objects (Birds, in this case) to pick up the still-saving parent object (Pirate in this case) and save it again.\r\n\r\nThe net result is that duplicate `UPDATE` queries are sent. While this is certainly an improvement over the existing behavior (which recurses infinitely in `changed_for_autosave?`) it's still wrong.\r\n\r\nThoughts on how to fix this? The parent record clearly should be savable again, to accommodate code that updates the parent in, say, an `after_save` on child records. `define_non_cyclic_method` already avoids the cycle in that case, so the saves don't recurse indefinitely.",

    "body": "Hi\n\nI'm using the relatively new --standalone feature/option of bundler so as to avoid extracting a part of my rails project into a separate project. My only requirement is to not have to load rails entirely:\n\nBy creating a custom gemfile (subset of your typical gemfile) and executing:\n\n    bundle install --gemfile=Gemfile.my_subset --standalone\n\nbundler will create a ruby script which requires all the gems in your gemfile subset using the\noriginal gems locations.\n\ne.g. :\n\n    path = File.expand_path('..', __FILE__)\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/rake-0.9.2.2/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/multi_json-1.0.4/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.1.6/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/builder-3.0.3/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/i18n-0.6.0/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activemodel-3.1.6/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/arel-2.2.3/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/tzinfo-0.3.33/lib\")\n    $:.unshift File.expand_path(\"#{path}/../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.1.6/lib\")\n    ...\n\nThis allows scripts to e.g. load just activerecord without setting up a separate\ngemfile.\n\nThe issue here is that with this setup script, you aren't using bundler (to avoid loading rails and \nthe gems in your typical gemfile.). Additionally, the gems the script requires are `expanded` gems\nand have not been installed via `gem install`.\n\nActiverecord connection adapters have this code:\n\n    gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.10'\n    require 'mysql2'\n\nThis code assumes:\n\n  * You're running the code within bundler (recommended)\n  * You have the mysql2 gem installed as a gem in your system\n\nWhen using bundler standalone neither of these cases are true so the app breaks with:\n\n   Please install the mysql2 adapter: `gem install activerecord-mysql2-adapter` (no such file to load -- active_record/connection_adapters/mysql2_adapter)\nbecause it hits the 'gem' call before it attempts to require 'mysql2'\n\nIMHO a better approach would be:\n\n    begin\n      require 'mysql2'\n    rescue LoadError\n      gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.10'\n      require 'mysql2'\n    end\n\nThis code assumes you already have mysql2 on your load path somehow and only if it raises an exception do we attempt to issue the `gem` call.\n\nIs this reasonable?\n\nI've coded up the changes against 3-1-stable (which is what we're using in production) but I can easily backport it to master (elsewhere) if people see this as a good idea.\n\nI had the same test failures before and after my changes: https://gist.github.com/3782040 (I tested sqlite3 and mysql/2)\n\nRegards,\n\nSaimon\n\nNote: See issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/7753 for original discussion.",

    "body": "basic work for supporting partitioned tables in postgresql\n\nthese changes are associated with this pull request: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7573\nwhich were changes associated with rails 3.2.8.\n\nIf I were to sum up the work, it would be:\n\n* provide an instance method arel_table used for any operation that has access to the instance should use the instance method to acquire an arel_table associated with the current models attributes.\n* alter class method arel_table to handle parameters, with no parameters do original work -- with parameters associate the table with the specific partitioned table determined by key attributes\n* provide methods to manage key attributes and values (these are the fields the db table is partitioned on)\n* provide an instance method table_name which calls the altered class method table_name which now takes attribute values that should determine the specific partitioned table to name\n* bunch of helper methods in postgresql connection area associated with schema management.  this is for reasons 1) create_schema seems like a useful method, 2) adding foreign key is needed because in postgres child partitions need to manage the foreign key references, 3) some sequence method changes to support tables in non-public (well non search path) schema: this is probably generally useful work as rails seems broken about non-public schemas\n* change any self.class.arel_table to self.arel_table\n* create is a little weird because it needs to acquire the primary key if it isn't supplied (for instance ID where your need to fetch from the sequence -- for this work to be complete we need to supply the model instance method \"prefetch_primary_key?\" instead of it being on connection since prefetching isn't needed for any tables that aren't partitioned by a primary key)\n* some helper methods for finds (from_partition(*x)) which we've found useful in our day to day coding.  this method just sets the table name (this is useful because find from the parent table even when partition keys are provided can take an inordinate time if the number of child tables is large -- so specifying the specific child table is useful).\n\nthe rest of the code to support partitioning is here: https://github.com/fiksu/partitioned/tree/rails-3-2-8-patching -- you'll need to pull from that branch (which doesn't try to patch rails -- so use it with this pull request).  the master branch patches rails 3.2.8 correctly -- you can use it on your own.  The current rubygem of partitioned patches rails in a different (and more conservative way) -- I don't think you should look at that code.\n\nYou could probably remove a bunch of stuff to make this code faster for the common non-partitioned case.\n\n* instance arel_table could just call class method arel_table\n* self.class.arel_table could just do the old work\n* instance table_name could just call class method table_name which did just the old work\n\nthen one might provide fixups for those methods for models where partitioning is desired.\n\nI think the ugliest part of this code is update -- although I haven't walked down this path, it would seem the best way to manage this would be to add a hook to attribute modifications and fix up the all arel_tables that the attributes point to if the partitioned key values changes\n\nI'm willing to help in any way that makes sense to support partitioning in a future rails version.\n",

    "body": "Currently, there is no way to unit test the Redirection module in ActionDispatch::Routing. Also, redirects are not recognized as paths using `recognize_path`. These problems lead to a potential false positive. If you have this routing:\n```ruby\nget 'help' => redirect('http://help.example.org/')\nget 'help' => 'help#index'\n```\nand this test:\n```ruby\ntest \"should recognize /help as help#index\" do\n  assert_recognizes({:controller => 'help', :action => 'index'}, '/help')\nend\n```\nthe test passes, but actually, it should recognize /help as a redirect.\n\nWith this commit, it fixes the false negative and allows for url redirection:\n```ruby\nget 'help' => redirect(\"http://example.org/\")\nassert_recognizes(\"http://example.org/\", \"/help\")\n```\nThis is just a start to fix this issue, as the Redirection module offers much more than just external url redirection. Would definitely be willing to discuss other ways to unit test redirection; however, i think it is a bug that assert_recognizes does not recognize redirection routes.\n\nMore referenced <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2488\">here</a>.",

    "body": "When calling quote_value the underlying connection sometimes requires\nmore information about the column to properly return the correct quoted\nvalue.\n\nI ran into this issue when using optimistic locking in JRuby and the\nactiverecord-jdbcmssql-adapter. In SQLSever 2000, we aren't allowed to\ninsert a integer into a NVARCHAR column type so we need to format it as\nN'3' if we want to insert into the NVARCHAR type. Unfortuantely, without\nthe column type being passed the connection adapter cannot properly return\nthe correct quote value because it doesn't know to return N'3' or '3'.\n\nThis patch is fairly straight forward where it just passes in the column\ntype into the quote_value so it can properly handle at the connection level. I feel it does not need any specific unit tests as the current tests should cover all of the cases, as I'm not extending or adding new functionality. The implementing connections should have their own tests to make sure that they make use of the column parameter.\n\nOverall I feel it's better to pass in the column type and let the concrete connection classes determine how to return a quoted_value.",

    "body": "The existing definition removes double quote characters, and hence returns invalid JSON, making it unsuitable for the most common use case: [bootstrapping JSON within a `<script>` element](http://jfire.io/blog/2012/04/30/how-to-securely-bootstrap-json-in-a-rails-view/).\r\n\r\nI am unaware of any use cases satisfied by the current behavior, which was [previously discussed on lighthouse](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1485-json_escape-eats-away-double-quotes) without coming to a satisfactory resolution. The original commit at 0ff7a2d89fc95dcb0a32ed92aab7156b0778a7ea does not indicate that the double quote behavior was intentional. It seems likely that it was simply an oversight after copy and pasting the definition of `html_escape`.\r\n\r\nSince Rails does not make it easy to correctly escape bootstrapped JSON, incorrect and insecure methods are widespread and incorrectly recommended: [1](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=raw+to_json&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1&type=Code&language=HTML%2BERB), [2](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=to_json+html_safe&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1&type=Code&language=HTML%2BERB), [3](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3758055/52207). This change, together with community education, would alleviate the situation.\r\n\r\nIt's worth discussion whether `json_escape` should always return HTML-safe strings, such that it can be used without explicitly calling `html_safe`:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<script>\r\n  var data = <%=j @data.to_json %>;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso related is the discussion of the other `j` helper at #3578.",

    "body": "ActionView has a fallback feature to render an `:html` format template as a \"template of last resort\" even when `:js` is the only format specified, to support rendering HTML-formatted responses to XHR requests.\r\n\r\nI believe this fallback is broken when using multiple view paths. LookupContext treats a requested `:js` format as `[:js, :html]` when rendering anything except a layout. So the first view path will be matched against formats of `[:js, :html]` before the second view path is considered. Thus an \"index.html.erb\" in the first path will prevent an \"index.js.erb\" in any subsequent view paths from being rendered, even though the only format requested was JS.\r\n\r\nMy fix pushes down the fallback to lookup time; it attempts to look up the JS template in the PathSet, rescues any MissingTemplate, and retries with :html. I was conflicted about using exceptions for flow control here, but I wanted to do as little violence to the PathSet API as possible, and it currently raises MissingTemplate on missing templates.\r\n\r\nSome care had to be taken to ensure that layouts still only render their first format (so, for example, a JS request never renders an HTML template). That motivated the introduction of the `@layout_format` ivar.\r\n\r\nMajor props to the Rails team, especially @josevalim, for how accessible this code is. I went from \"hmm, that's weird\" to a failing test case in about 30 minutes. Thanks!",

    "body": "I discovered a bug in the nested attributes assignment: It occurs when\r\nan association callback changes the \"loaded-ness\" of the association\r\nduring the assignment. After association.loaded? changes from false to\r\ntrue, the destroy flag fails to function. The first commit illustrates\r\nthe issue with a unit test. The test fails in the master branch -\r\ncherry-picked to 3-2-stable, 3-1-stable, 3-0-stable fails the same way.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is the suggested fix. It replaces a section that\r\npreviously addressed the same issue of recognizing if a record was\r\nalready in the proxy_target array. When it wasn't, it called\r\nadd_to_target, which in turn calls the before_add callback. IMO this is\r\nnot correct, because the record concerned already exists in the database\r\nas part of the association. The documentation of the callback states\r\nthat an exception may be raised to prevent the record from being added\r\nto the association which contradicts the fact. Therefore I just plainly\r\nappended the record to the proxy_target array. (The unit test in the\r\nfirst commit pins down this behaviour). The fix is tested on sqlite on\r\nmaster, 3-2-stable, 3-1-stable. The fix to 3-0-stable is slightly\r\ndifferent, so there is another pull request off of branch\r\nnested_attributes_with_callbacks_bug_3-0 (if I manage to create one...).\r\n\r\nConsidering the whole method\r\nassign_nested_attributes_for_collection_association - it almost\r\nexclusively calls methods on the association and its logic is deeply\r\nentangled with the implmentation details of the CollectionAssociation\r\nclass. I've seen some effort to augment the responsibilites of the\r\nassociation classes, which IMO points in the right direction. A next\r\nstep to clear up this spot would be to move the main part of the method\r\nto something like \"CollectionAssociation.attributes=\" - any comments!?\r\n",

I propose to rename public methods of  `ActiveRecord::TestFixtures` module as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfixture_path        -> fixture_directory_path\r\nfixture_table_names -> fixture_set_names\r\n# fixture_table_names  be reserved to return a hash of the form { \"fixture_set/name\" => \"fixture_table_name\", ... }\r\nfixture_class_names -> fixture_model_names\r\nset_fixture_class   -> set_fixture_model\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis extends PR #4254, where i only tried to give consistent and descriptive names to local variables.\r\n\r\nI've posted about this on the mailing list, but there were no comments:\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/22491c3963433854\r\n\r\nMy motivation was to be consistent in how `directory`, `path`, `table_name` etc. are used.  Also to me `fixture_model` is more flexible and descriptive than `fixture_class`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think: if you are happy with existing names, or you have better suggestions, or you like some of the proposed changes but not the other.",

    "body": "Strings with invalid encodings can cause unexpected exceptions to occur in ruby. For example any regex that is run on a string containing invalid UTF-8 bytes will cause an exception. When these strings are passed to external systems which don't correctly handle invalid UTF-8 byte sequences it can cause unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this commit breaks the previous handling of multipart/mixed files. The previous behaviour was to expose the whole of the unparsed content in a single parameter. Because the multipart/mixed parameter whose proper encoding is binary is indistinguishable from other parameters whose proper encoding is UTF-8 breakage is unavoidable. If we want to support multipart/mixed properly we need rack to do the parsing.\r\n\r\n~~Also, because of the presence of the unicode tick on most requests this change will prevent any system sending a non-utf8 encoding of this character from interacting with the web application. It may be worth changing the check to happen on specific parameter access rather than check all parameters when a single parameter has been accessed.
