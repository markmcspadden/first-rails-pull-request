But there's another thing here, if we change table name we'll want to see that foreign key will be changed too.\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Namespace\r\n  class Base < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    self.table_name = 'tablename'\r\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :somethings\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nIn case above foreign_key for HABTM will be `base_id`, and for all associations we have to set it manually. I decided to add new option for it, this way we can set it for the whole class and descendants. Any other suggestions? /cc @pixeltrix",
