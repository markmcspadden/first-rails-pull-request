I'm pushing it here for a few reasons:\n\n* Feedback before I get too carried away is welcome.\n* Everyone gets a little more visibility of how (I think) rake tasks should be approached.\n* I'm short of time, so others may wish to contribute (and if so, get in touch).\n\nBut as to what's happening in these commits, essentially:\n\n* I want to get every single rake task that has a db prefix down to a single line of code\n* All the logic ends up in classes and objects.\n* Easier to read, easier to maintain, easier to test, easier to reuse.\n* Currently, I've done this for db:create, db:drop, db:create:all and db:drop:all.\n* My plan is for adapter-specific tasks to end up in DatabaseTasks, but then there'll also be MigrationTasks, SchemaTasks, FixturesTasks, TestTasks, and maybe one or two others.\n\nAnd finally, my questions for right now:\n\n* Does anyone want to help?\n* Core committers, would something like this get accepted, or am I wasting my time?\n",

    "body": "This is currently not possible using `#default` method because\n\n```ruby\nconfig.action_mailer.default(from: \"no-replay@example.org\")\n```\n\nis interpreated as reader method and just returns nil. It does not call `ActionMailer::Base.default` method. The only way of calling `ActionMailer::Base` methods from `config/application.rb` is to use the direct syntax which is ugly in my opinion:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.assets.enabled = false\nconfig.assets.version = '1.0'\nconfig.encoding = \"utf-8\"\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options={host:\"example.org\", protocol:\"https\" }\nActionMailer::Base.default(from: \"no-replay@example.org\")\n```\n\nAlso the `:from` option is probably the same across multiple mailers. Other options like `:to, :subject, :cc, :bcc` etc. differ between mailing templates but `:from` is usually constant. So i think it deserves a simple way for setting it.",

    "body": "Fix `db:schema:load` + `:dump`: look first in DATABASE_URL, then database.yml.\n\n\nCurrently when I run `heroku run rake db:migrate` on Heroku with the official\nRails 3.2.6 I get:\n\n    ...\n    <migrations>\n    ...\n    database configuration does not specify adapter\n\n... and then rake fails.\n\nMy findings:\n\nThis last line is printed by `db:schema:dump` called from within `db:migrate`.\n\n`db:migrate` \"itself\" (`ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate`) uses\n`with_connection`, which succeeds, while `db:schema:dump` uses\n`ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connect(Rails.env)` followed by\n`ActiveRecord::Base.connection`, which fails.\n\nThe latter call unconditionally looks in config/database.yml for the database\nsettings, whereas the former uses whatever settings were initialized by Rails.\n\nWhen Rails is initializing, `Railties::ActiveRecord` calls\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection without parameters.\n\n\nRemoving the `Rails.env` argument allows `establish_connect` to probe for the\ncorrect settings itself, and then it picks `DATABASE_URL` first, regardless of\n`RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV`. This seems to me the more proper behaviour.\n\n\nIf I set `RAILS_ENV=production`, not only `RACK_ENV=production`, for some reason\nthat works. Possibly heroku's database.yml contains a `#{RAILS_ENV}:` line or\nsomething along those lines, I haven't checked. Either way, it doesn't affect\nthe above reasoning for the proper behaviour of `db:schema:dump`.\n\nThis pull request also contains the equivalent fix for `db:schema:load`.\n",

This seems to me the more proper behaviour.\n\n\nIf I set `RAILS_ENV=production`, not only `RACK_ENV=production`, for some reason\nthat works. Possibly heroku's database.yml contains a `#{RAILS_ENV}:` line or\nsomething along those lines, I haven't checked. Either way, it doesn't affect\nthe above reasoning for the proper behaviour of `db:schema:dump`.\n\nThis pull request also contains the equivalent fix for `db:schema:load`.\n",

To ensure this, a js runtime may not be available on the app\nservers. In this environment, pages using javascript_include_tag for\nassets with non-standard or chained extensions were throwing 500 errors.\nFor instance, `javascript_include_tag('jquery.min')` would blow up.\n\nSprockets was attempting to build the assets being included during the\nrewrite_extension step (responsible for appending a '.js' extension to\nassets being included by the basename rather than a fully qualified\nname). This was happening as a step to resolve #6310, which required\nchecking for the presence of an asset with a non-standard extension\nbefore appending the extension.\n\nWe can check for the presence of an asset without invoking the asset\nbuild step by using Sprockets' resolve method, which will search for the\nbase file without building it (and is the method that find_asset uses\ninternally to get the path to the asset before attempting to build it).\n\nWhen rewriting the extension on an asset, these are the steps:\n- If the source does not have an extension, assume that the default\n  extension is desired and append it.\n- If there is an extension and it doesn't match the default extension,\n  check to see if a file with the precise name specified exists amongst\n  the assets; if it is present, do not append the default extension.\n  (This is the step that resolves #6310).\n",

Therefore, gzip compression becomes responsibility of rack middleware. \n\nIn absence of this setting, people have resorted to hacking [config.ru directly](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7236583/where-to-insert-rackdeflater-in-the-rack). this patch provides a clean way, if anyone want to enable gzip compression at app server level",
