The majority of this pull request creates a module which queries for file system changes using the Ruby IO classes (note that it doesn't require any C or operating system specific extensions).\r\n\r\nI've added the capability to listen for file additions, modifications, and deletions and send these on to a new notification queue. Subscribing to this queue will allow you to receive file system updates.\r\n\r\nThe Notifications module is also changed because of this. There is now a notion of the type of Notification one is subscribing to. The regular notifications are the canonical notifications that one could subscribe to in the previous code. However, there is now a filesystem notification that one can subscribe to. There is a completely separate notification queue for each type of notification.\r\n\r\nI kept the previous methods for the regular notifications intact for backwards compatibility, but I also included methods such as \"subscribe_with_type\" or \"publish_with_type\" which allows you do deal with notifications of a particular type.\r\n\r\nThe code is still in its infancy and looks pretty raw, so I'm looking forward to comments. \r\n",

    "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is described in [Potential Query Manipulation with Common Rails Practises](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/ZOdH5GH5jCU), which notes that \"it is not possible for ActiveRecord to automatically protect against all instances of this attack\".  However, it is possible to handle the case where the column type is known.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(:login_token=>params[:token]).first\r\n```\r\nperforms the query\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `login_token` = 0 LIMIT 1;\r\n```\r\nwhere it will match any login_token that starts with a non-digit character.  But since active record can determine that login_token is a string type column, it can quote the integer it is being compared with as follows.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `login_token` = '0' LIMIT 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will have the desired affect of only matching the exact string '0'.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nModify the connection adapter's `quote` method to quote the numeric value as a SQL string if the column it is being compared with is known to be non-numeric.  Boolean values are represented as the integers 0 or 1 for some databases, so booleans are also quoted as SQL strings when comparing against a string type column.\r\n\r\nThe PredicateBuilder also needed to be modified to ensure that integers are quoted, since Arel treats them as literals.  Quoting the integer and passing it to Arel as a `Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral` object will ensure that the value is not double quoted.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nSQL fragments with quoted values have no information about the column type, so the following is still unsafe.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(\"login_token = ?\", params[:token])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parameters to the SQL fragment should still be converted to the correct type before passing it to active record as follows.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(\"login_token = ?\", params[:token].to_s)\r\n```",
