When this happened, delimiters and separators were no longer being html_escaped.\n\nFor example, \n```ruby\nnumber_with_delimiter(1000, :delimiter =>'<script></script>')\n```\nwill produce the string\n```ruby\n\"1<script></script>000\" \n```\nmarked as html_safe.\n\nThis pull request makes both delimiters and separators html_escaped, and adds tests for this behavior.\n\nSee https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ecfb32cd165c0763befb7eed7e348438db928cef for more info\n\nLikely interested parties: @carlosantoniodasilva and @josevalim",

Based on `change_schema_test.rb` I guess it must have been because it was expected some people would use `:limit => 11` for MySQL expecting an `int(11)`, which isn't the same thing as an 11 byte int, which is what :limit is for.\n\nI believe this should raise, if it isn't a valid value, rather than silently changing what the user has specified, wrong as it may be.",

    "body": "Relates to #6247.\n\nSQLite3 does not support the 'time' data type.  I feel like we shouldn't pretend it does.\n\nAs it is now, if you create a new record with time only, the year gets set as the current year in the database.  However, as in issue #6247 when you do `Alert.all` it shows the year as being 2000.  Subsequently you get this behavior:\n\n``` irb\nirb(main):028:0> Alert.create(start: Time.now)\n   (0.1ms)  begin transaction\n  SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO \"alerts\" (\"created_at\", \"start\", \"updated_at\") VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [[\"created_at\", Wed, 16 May 2012 03:54:09 UTC +00:00], [\"start\", 2012-05-15 22:54:09 -0500], [\"updated_at\", Wed, 16 May 2012 03:54:09 UTC +00:00]]\n   (2.4ms)  commit transaction\n=> #<Alert id: 7, start: \"2012-05-15 22:54:09\", created_at: \"2012-05-16 03:54:09\", updated_at: \"2012-05-16 03:54:09\">\nirb(main):029:0> Alert.all\n  Alert Load (0.3ms)  SELECT \"alerts\".* FROM \"alerts\" \n=> [#<Alert id: 7, start: \"2000-01-01 03:54:09\", created_at: \"2012-05-16 03:54:09\", updated_at: \"2012-05-16 03:54:09\">]\nirb(main):030:0> Alert.last.start < Time.utc(2000, 1, 1, 3, 55, 0)\n  Alert Load (0.2ms)  SELECT \"alerts\".* FROM \"alerts\" ORDER BY \"alerts\".\"id\" DESC LIMIT 1\n=> true\nirb(main):031:0> Alert.where('start < ?', Time.utc(2000, 1, 1, 3, 55, 0))\n  Alert Load (0.3ms)  SELECT \"alerts\".* FROM \"alerts\" WHERE (start < '2000-01-01 03:55:00.000000')\n=> []\n\n```\nIt isn't very consistent to show `start: \"2000-01-01\"` and yet not find it.  The reason is it really has year 2012 in the database.\n\nI realize the year is just a dummy year since Ruby doesn't support any concept of time only.  But the difference is MySQL and PostgreSQL don't actually store the year in the database, where as SQLite does, and it doesn't match what Rails displays.\n\nAs an aside, I had to add:\n\n``` ruby\nActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_attributes = false\nActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :local\nTime.zone = nil\n```\nto a couple of the tests, because when I changed line 955 to skip SQLite3 adapter, those lines getting skipped at the end were causing those other two tests to fail.  I don't see any tests that set those attributes and not set them back, but I guess something funny is going on there.",
