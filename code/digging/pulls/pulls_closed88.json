    "body": "As @twinturbo objected in pull request #6063, here's a separate request for this change and expanded reasoning.\r\n\r\nReasons to make `notify_observers` public:\r\n\r\n- consistent with the fact that `notify_observers` in the stdlib's `Observable` is public.\r\n- consistent with the fact that the singleton method `notify_observers` is public:\r\n\r\n    Foo.notify_observers(:my_event, the_foo) # => currently ok\r\n    the_foo.notify_observers(:my_event) # => currently not ok\r\n\r\n- `notify_observers` is not the right level to restrict access. Some actions would be best kept private (say :after_save) but custom actions could very well be triggered by external clients. The class and its instances simply act as a rendez-vous point where complete strangers to the class can communicate.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAn observer implements `:after_save` to detect some state change. If detected, it wants to send a custom notification `:some_state_changed`, so other observers can be notified and don't have to reimplement the state change logic. It shouldn't have to use `send`.\r\n\r\nThanks",

You guys knew it when changing `ActiveRecord::Base#save` from `save(false)` to `save(:validate => false)`.\r\n\r\nI suggest also remove boolean argument `include_seconds` from `distance_of_time_in_words` and `time_ago_in_words`, replacing in with `include_seconds => true` hash option. Of course to keep it as deprecated option. This is somehow a resurrection of #898.\r\n\r\nAlso it makes `time_ago_in_words` to pass options hash, including a `locale` key, which makes in compatible with `distance_of_time_in_words`.",
