I've read the guidelines but I may have missed something, please point it out.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very small change, but I noticed some code in activemodel and activesupport require all files from a specific directory, but they files are sorted before, which does not seem to be useful or needed, and only cause a little overhead when booting rails.\r\nMoreover, the way the files are required is not consistent with the rest of the code.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?",
