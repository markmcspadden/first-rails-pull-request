    "body": "The mysql database adaptor assumes that non-null text columns behave as if the default value is an empty string. This is the default behaviour for mysql connections, but putting the connection in strict mode with `SET SQL_MODE='STRICT_ALL_TABLES'` makes like other databases, where the default value is NULL so the value must be specified.\r\n\r\nThe mysql adaptor defaults to using this strict mode, although it can be disabled with setting `strict: false` in the database configuration. However, the mysql adapter has a hack based on non-strict mode behaviour to detect an empty string default value. So even though strict mode is used, this hack is continuing non-strict mode behaviour within strict mode.\r\n\r\nI propose just removing this hack to mimic the non-strict behaviour to make its behaviour consistent with other databases.  This is what this pull request does.",

    "body": "Dynamic error pages have many benefits over static, for instance they can use the default layout if desired. By generating dynamic error pages by default we can encourage developers to take advantage of this already existing feature and build better sites. In addition to moving people towards dynamically generating their error pages we can add prompts to the default pages. One example is telling devs how to get to their logs. I have added erb to `errors/500.html.erb` that I believe will be extremely helpful to new developers.\n\nWhile walking users through a deployment (such as with http://railsgirls.com/materials) they often are not familiar with how to retrieve logs on a given system. I've added a dynamic section that will look for an environment variable `CHECK_LOG_INSTRUCTIONS` and if present show a corresponding message. I can then work with @hone to get a debug log message into the [ruby buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby) something like `$ heroku logs --tail`. While we've added a number of great error messages to Rails, helping developers find those error messages is crucial to their sustained success. This isn't just for new devs either. Experienced Rails developers who are new to a system might not know how to access its logs.\n\nBy relying on an ENV var we're not coupling the message to any one provider, and if no message is present we fall back on the default error page. It would be the responsibility of providers to set this message on a given system.\n\nMoving in this direction we should also port over `public/index.html` to a dynamic page. This change can be found in a separate PR with it's own set of benefits #7771\n\nScreenshot when running production with `CHECK_LOG_INSTRUCTIONS` set:\n\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2E2J3u2b1d2S3s3Y3l1V/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-27%20at%2011.00.16%20AM.png)",

    "body": "Rails is a dynamic framework that serves a static `index.html` by default. One of my first questions ever on IRC was solved by \"delete your index.html\". This file is a source of confusion when starting as it over-rides any set \"root\" in the routes yet it itself is not listed in the routes. By making the page dynamic by default we can eliminate this confusion and show people how to set the root on their project all at the same time.\n\nI encounter this question any time I am helping someone new learn Rails, and it is advice repeated again and again from our comments in rails/rails to external tutorials. We can remove this extra step and show people how to use rails root in the routes by allowing the index to be dynamic. \n\nIn addition to helping new programmers, this will help Rails engine gem's that need to redirect to a url. Many of them would like to use `root_url` such as devise, but cannot count on it being there. This change adds in a default page for the root to avoid this issue and to standardize on a place for custom landing pages for applications. If no custom landing page is desired one can easily remove the route, controller, and view. Alternatively they could change the root in routes and leave the other files if they might want a custom landing page eventually. \n\nScreenshot:\n\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/38212K0w1P063u2I0g2E/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-25%20at%204.51.42%20PM.png)",

Currently its not possible to have a nested describe on a controller test.\n\n    describe WidgetsController, :index do\n      describe \"authenticated user\" do\n        it \"is accessible\" do\n          assert_response :success\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nThis request makes this possible by adding the ability to resolve constants from the test name. It also includes additional spec registration for mailer, helper, and integration tests. Oh, and a bunch of tests too. (All of this code was taken from minitest-rails.)\n\nFixes #7748",
