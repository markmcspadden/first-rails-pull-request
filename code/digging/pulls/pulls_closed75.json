    "body": "See https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6569 for info.\n\nI only ran ActiveModel tests, so if you have bad test isolation you might have to fix some tests outside ActiveModel, if they use validates_format_of.\n\nDiscussion:\nObviously the description in the security guides is not enough since ^$ are misused even in most of the ActiveModel tests. You even give an exploitable regexp as an example in http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html!\nSo if the problem is present even in core Rails then I don't think there's anything to think about.\n\nWe have seen this exploited on Github, Soundcloud, Tumblr, your own docs, your own tests, even veteran Rails developers make this mistake. Yes I always said this only partially solves the problem BUT it is the best solution I've seen, because it does cover the vast majority of vulnerabilities and at the same time the effect on proper code is negligible, even more so because proper code usually does not need to use ^$ in format validation (it really is a corner case). And even if you have this corner case the error goes away by adding one simple option to your validator.\nThere is no way of completely solving this without changing the Ruby language defaults and breaking loads of existing code, which wouldn't make sense because this is how behavior for RegExp is defined in Ruby and I doubt this will change, nor is there a real reason to change it.\nAnd again I will reiterate, the vast majority of related vulnerabilities come when a bad regexp is used with validates_format_of, and in the vast majority of cases using ^$ in validates_format_of is wrong so this change affects almost no one who already has proper code. The ^$ are mostly useful with gsub and extracting subpatterns, not for validation.\n\nI mean think about it, when did you need a validation that accepts multiline input and only needs 1 of the lines to match the RegExp to be valid? Never? With that in mind it would not be such a stretch anymore to say it's actually a vulnerability or at least poor behavior and not just an educational problem. Using ^$ in format validators is a corner case and should be treated as such. If you need validation like that you are doing something really weird and there's probably a better way to do it without requiring validation like that.",

    "body": "\n\n## Problem\n\nAfter a member of a team adds commits new code and a migration, other developers might not notice the migration and will get `NoMethodError`, `UnknownAttributeError`, or other exceptions raised.\n\nI've seen this behavior confuse beginner rails developers and seasoned devs. Usually they are capable of figuring out they need to run migrations, but the error is misleading, frustrating, and potentially time consuming.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nraise error for pending migration\n\nCan be configured by setting `config.active_record.migration`. Setting to `:page_load` will raise an error on each page refresh if there are migrations that are pending. Setting to `:page_load` is defaulted in development for new applications.\n\nSetting `config.active_record.migration` to `:app_start` will raise an error when the app is initialized if there are pending migrations. Setting to `:app_start` is defaulted in test mode.\n\nThis check is turned off in production.\n\nThe check can be disabled by setting `config.active_record.skip_migration_errors = true`. This is useful when the error would conflict with fixing the problem such as having an error on `:app_start`  and trying to run `rake db:migrate` which starts the app. A convenience rake task is also included to be run before `:environment` is loaded on crucial tasks.\n\n\n## Notes\n\nThis PR picks up where #4165 left off.\n\nScreenshot of `:page_load` error: http://cl.ly/0Q0t3z1s3R2Z142p2o1B\n\nScreenshot of `:app_start` error: http://cl.ly/1k0c1i2O0v122T3P2Y1n\n\nRailties Tests are green: https://gist.github.com/2885779\n\nAR Tests are green: https://gist.github.com/2885796\n\ncc/ @jonleighton\n",

The problem is that the fix is not only incorrect, it actually introduced a new bug.\n\nThe fix as merged converts paths pointing to index.* files into paths pointing at their enclosing directories. This is the opposite of the documented behavior -- if the original path is a directory, 'index' needs to be added to the path to find the file inside the directory.",

    "body": "Issue \\#3993 was about Sprockets not acting as documented in production environments.\n\nSpecifically, during assets precompile, 'javascript_include_tag' et al are supposed to notice when the included path is a directory, and use an 'index.js' or 'index.css' file from inside that directory as a manifest:\n\nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#using-index-files\n\n\\#3993 was closed when a fix (SHA: df8457748ebbfa092c4c10aedda57aeef2f28776) was merged.  The problem is that the fix is not only incorrect, it actually introduced a new bug.\n\nThe fix as merged converts paths pointing to index.* files into paths pointing at their enclosing directories.  This is the opposite of the documented behavior -- if the original path is a directory, 'index' needs to be *added* to the path to find the file inside the directory.\n\nThat commit therefore broke asset precompile such that any existing asset files named 'index.(js|css)' are completely skipped over, without fixing the original issue.  This commit fixes the new bug and makes the feature work as documented, actually resolving \\#3993.\n",

    "body": "Issue \\#3993 was about Sprockets not acting as documented in production environments.\n\nSpecifically, during assets precompile, 'javascript_include_tag' is supposed to notice when the included path is a directory, and use an 'index.js' or 'index.css' file from inside that directory as a manifest:\n\nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#using-index-files\n\n\\#3993 was closed when a fix (SHA: df8457748ebbfa092c4c10aedda57aeef2f28776) was merged.  The problem is that the fix is not only incorrect, it actually introduced a new bug.\n\nThe fix as merged converts paths pointing to index.* files into paths pointing at their enclosing directories.  This is the opposite of the documented behavior -- if the original path is a directory, 'index' needs to be *added* to the path to find the file inside the directory.\n\nThat commit therefore broke asset precompile such that any existing asset files named 'index.(js|css)' are completely skipped over, without fixing the original issue.  This commit fixes the new bug and makes the feature work as documented, actually resolving \\#3993.\n",
