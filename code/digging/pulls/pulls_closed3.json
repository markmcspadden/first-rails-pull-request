    "body": "Currently, if a postgres table contains a record with a binary field and this record is fetched from the DB, an exception is raised if the binary data is nil.\r\n\r\nThis bug is due to the fact that the unescaping of the column value is passed directly to `PGConn` without checking for nil. `PGConn#unescape_bytea` does a check on the value type and raise an exception if the value isn't a string.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests around the binary type (currently no tests exist), and a fix for the mentioned bug.",

However calling those non selectd columns\r\nraises exception.\r\n\r\n    post = Post.select(\"'title' as post_title\").first\r\n\r\nIn the above case when `post.body` is invoked then an exception is\r\nraised since `body` attribute is not selected. Howevere `respond_to?`\r\ndid not behave correctly.\r\n\r\n    pos.respond_to?(:body) #=> true\r\n\r\nReason was that Active Record calls `super` to pass the call to\r\nActive Model and all the columns are defined on Active Model.\r\n\r\nFix is to actually check if the data returned from the db contains\r\nthe data for column in question.\r\n\r\n@jonleighton can you take a look?
