    "body": "ActiveModel::SecurePassword currently has a class method #min_cost that is used to set a boolean value to change the cost factor of bcrypt-ruby to either 4 (MIN_COST of bcrypt-ruby) or 10 (DEFAULT in bcrypt-ruby).\n\nIf you want to have more fine-grained control over the cost factor you need to override the #password= method of the SecurePassword module with your own model that is using has_secure_password. \n\nThis PR removes the #min_cost class method and replaces it with a #cost class method which takes an integer.  A developer can then set this class method to a specific value is required by their application by doing:\n\n```ruby\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    has_secure_password\n    ActiveModel::SecurePassword.cost = 15\n  end\n```\n\n#cost maintains the same behavior of #min_cost where it is set to the MIN_COST during tests and defaults to bcrypt-ruby's DEFAULT value. \n\nI personally like having a bit more control over the hash stretches for when I need it, in a simple class setter method instead of override an instance method. \n\nHowever, I feel like this is the middle of the road solution. I think a better implementation would be:\n\n```ruby\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    has_secure_password cost: 15\n  end\n```\n\n#has_secure_password class method already has support for hash parameters (validations), so adding another key/value for cost is trivial. \n\nSecondly, I think it would be better to set the min_cost and default_cost using bcrypt-ruby's constants instead of integers as I did in this implementation. \n\nI'm opening this PR to show what I've added and start the conversation on what I think would be the better implementation. I don't want to go too far down the road if the Core/Others feel this isn't the right direction.  Thanks! ",

    "body": "Sorry, I messed up with previous issue (#8383) by submitting pull-request on the wrong base :(\n\nI'm trying to render a json/jbuilder template inside of a regular html template. Here is the code of the helper I'm using\n\n```ruby\ndef get_some_json_stuff\n   render partial: 'my_json_partial', handler: [:jbuilder], formats: [:json], locals: { foo: @bar }\nend\n```\n\nEverything goes fine in most cases, the template renders and I'm getting a string of json — exactly what I want.\n\nBut when there is an exception in the json template, funny things start to happen. Basically, I'm seeing this description: \n\n```\nMissing partial /my_json_partial with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :jbuilder, :coffee]}. Searched in:\n  * \"/my/app/views\"\n```\n\nI've looked into actionpack in attempt to understand what's going on and here's what I've found.\n\nThe code goes into [render method](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L142) then the error actually happens and gets rescued by [handle_render_error ](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L310) method.\n\nAnd then it comes to [refresh](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L163) method that actually tries to reload the broken template. Doing so, it completely ignores original template format and handler, trying to use view's defaults, therefore failing and showing completely unrelevant exception.",

Basically, I'm seeing this description: \n\n```\nMissing partial /my_json_partial with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :jbuilder, :coffee]}. Searched in:\n  * \"/my/app/views\"\n```\n\nI've looked into actionpack in attempt to understand what's going on and here's what I've found.\n\nThe code goes into [render method](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L142) then the error actually happens and gets rescued by [handle_render_error ](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L310) method.\n\nAnd then it comes to [refresh](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.9/actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb#L163) method that actually tries to reload the broken template. Doing so, it completely ignores original template format and handler, trying to use view's defaults, therefore failing and showing completely unrelevant exception.",

    "body": "Given the latest discussion on rails-core google group, rather than just discussing this one I'm providing working code. I think Rails is missing a way to filter redirect logs. It makes sense to me, given redirect logs could hold sensible informations the same way POST params do. \nThe typical example is when you redirect to S3 signed URLs, which is my case. People is sending out logs to third party services for analysis, this feature will at least give them a way to have more control over what they send.\n\nI was thinking about a way to make a gem out of it, but I seems that the current implementation does not leave room for anything to plug other than a monkeypatch. Advices on how to make a gem for this are of welcome of course.",

Perform the actual select to instantiate AR objects\n\nCurrently step one also instantiated intermediate ActiveRecord objects just to pick the ID from them. This changes fetches the IDs using `select_all`, which does not instante objects.\n\nThe intermediate objects were a problem because the `after_find` callback was triggered twice. Also I think it does not make sense to instantiate objects that we don't actually need.\n\nThis is a fix for #3313\n\nI'm not sure if my test-case is very helpful. It was the best I could come up with to illustrate the problem.",
