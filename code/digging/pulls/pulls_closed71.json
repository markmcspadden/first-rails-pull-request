    "body": "If you selectively require core_exts (e.g., `require 'active_support/core_ext/string'`), it is possible for\n`active_support/core_ext/time/calculations` to be required when `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` is not available. If this happens, the next call to `Time.=== will` fail with a `NameError`. This pull fixes this issue.\n\nThen nature of this problem is not amenable to unit testing, but I can provide a [script][gist] which demonstrates the problem.\n\nThis bug was introduced in Rails 3.2.4 and is present in 3.2.5, 3.2.6, 3-2-stable, and master.\n\n[gist]: https://gist.github.com/2990831/",

    "body": "The current implementation on Rails is not capable of handling an object with **time only**, it only allows you to create an object with both time **and** date, which isn't really nice as you can create a **time only** column in almost all database systems.\n\nThis fix adds support for time only object creation (if the column is created as **:time**) by using Ruby's Time object. The date fields will default to \"January 1, 1970\" since Ruby doesn't have an object for time only. Implementation also includes specs showing what's the correct behavior and also a failure if you try to create a time only object of a column of type datetime.\n\nThis pull request fixes issue #6825.",

    "body": "By some reasons, if someone will put these options in javascript_include_tag or stylesheet_link_tag it will\ncause strange errors (when sprockets is enable for app). For me it took about work day to detect what exactly happened.\n\nYou can easy reproduce the error: just create new rails 3.2 app, generate simple controller with one action, specify root action in routes and add :cache => true, :cache => \"foo\" or :concat => \"foo\" to the end of any javascript_include_tag or stylesheet_link_tag helpers.\n\nI am in the middle of migrating 2.3.x app to 3.2.x for my current project, so I have a lot of legacy :cache options. Unfortunately current exception is too hard to undersand situation for developers, without spending time to debugging Rails. \n\nI suggest to ignore :cache and :concat options for js and css sprockets tag helpers (like I have done). Also I think that sprockets may detect these options and say something (for example it can show warning). \n\nIf something wrong in my commit let me know and I will fix it asap. Hope it will help someone.",

    "body": "ActiveRecord model constructors accept a hash of parameters which are used to invoke the corresponding attribute writer methods. Attribute writers are privately invoked with #send, but they are first screened with #respond_to? to avoid invoking private methods. This precludes the common practice of encapsulating members by allowing them to be initialized at construction but not reassigned after construction.\n\nThis patch enables the constructor to invoke private attribute writers by accepting an additional option (:with_private) along with the options which are used to control mass-assignment protection.",

    "body": "This patch addresses the difficulty of retrieving datetime fields. By default, the database holds a higher precision than the time as a String. Currently there isn't a sensible way to specify a precision on timestamp fields. \n\nHowever, you are able to get postgres to accept a precision by sending along a :limit option from ActiveRecord. This commit is an attempt to swap that responsibility with :precision, as I think it was intended.\n\nThis issue is discussed at length at the following links:\n- [#3519](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3519)\n- [#3520](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3520)\n\nAlso, kudos to @mattscilipoti for pointing it out in the above issues.\n\nThanks!",

    "body": "This patch is to remove a default from ActiveSupport's inflections. The\ncurrent default of words ending in \"fe\" to be pluralized as \"ves\" is\nstrange in that this is a grammatical exception rather than the rule.\nThe conversion of \"f\" to \"ve\" in pluralization is not as common as the\ncase of simply adding the \"s\" and, when the exception does occur, should\nwe really care? I believe it can end up causing more confusion than anything\nelse. Aside from words like \"half\" (which was covered in the same rule\nbut with a different regex case), or the words \"life\" (and perhaps \"knife\" for Chef\nusers), I am unsure as to why people would need to pluralize these words. I\nwould be open to discussion on what other words should be added to the list\nof irregulars, but when is the last time you saw `has_many :wives`?\n\nSigned-off-by: David Celis <david@davidcelis.com>",
