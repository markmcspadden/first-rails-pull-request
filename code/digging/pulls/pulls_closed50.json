    "body": "The documentation for `UrlHelper#link_to` describes a :remote option, which can be set in either the `html_options` or `(url_)options` hashes. But the option is checked as a stringified key ('remote'), and only the `html_options` hash is stringified before this check takes place, so that :remote is ignored if passed in the other hash as a symbol.\r\n\r\nThis problem exists on 3.2-stable, but an additional issue exists on master: Master passes the options hash to `UrlHelper#url_for` before consuming and deleting the :remote option. As a result, both the string and symbol forms are used for url-generation before they are used to set the data-remote attribute. This patch also addresses this issue.\r\n\r\nI pushed a 3-2 backport to `link_to_remote_3_2` in my repository, in case that's useful. Thanks!",

    "body": "\r\n\r\nCurrently if a Rails application uses the ActiveSupport::NumberHelper#number_to_human_size to provide a user with information like \"2000.34 TB\" the information is ambiguous (hence not very usefull). It is unknown whether that information means 2000.34*1000⁴ or whether that information means 2000.34*1024⁴. Not even if a user tries to download rails and figure out what it means, is it possible to tell. Because the Rails application (with undisclosed source code) may either call ActiveSupport::NumberHelper#number_to_human_size with or without the :prefix => :si option. The :prefix => :si option changes the exponent base but without changing the notation.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting to change the ActiveSupport::NumberHelper#number_to_human_size so that notation goes hand in hand with the exponent base. Using binary (IEC) prefix for exponent base 1024 and SI prefix for exponent base 1000. My proposal can be seen as this pull request: rails/rails#7829\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on whether or not the default is IEC or SI, as long as the notatation goes hand in hand with the exponent base, so information like \"2000.34 TB\" and \"2000.34 TiB\" is unambiguous.\r\n\r\nEven a bit worse is that the current default behaviour (i.e. without the :prefix => :si option )is to incorrectly use SI notation for exponent base 1024, which is against international accepted standards[1].\r\n\r\nBefore you argue that IEC notation is not (yet) widespread: Remember that HTML5 is not (yet) widespread either, it is not even expected to finalise until 2014 (which probably will be delayed), but that doesn't imply that Rails should stay away from it.\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix\r\n",
