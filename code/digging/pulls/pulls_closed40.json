This is useful when cache-expiration needs to be performed manually and it would be otherwise difficult to know the exact name of a digested cache key.\n\n@dhh requested I submit this PR, more information can be found here: https://github.com/rails/cache_digests/pull/16\n\nNote that the cache_digests gem also checks to see if a cache fragment is explicitly versioned using the following heuristic:\n\n1. The cache key is an array\n2. The first item in that array is in the format of \"v{digits}\" (e.g. [\"v2\",project] would be considered explicitly versioned)\n\nI have **not** added support for this feature in this PR but I can add it fairly easily if you would like it. Adding the \"explicitly versioned key\" check would bring the rails master functionality in-line with gem's behavior.",

I tracked the problem down to bff4d8d165486797227c5933e93a62e7f2c15d98 where a particular line of code was removed. Restoring this line fixes my issue.\n\nAs you can probably tell I know very little about the internals of rails, so I don't know if restoring this line causes problems elsewhere.",

    "body": "Dear @tenderlove and @josevalim, I would like your opinions on this before I merge it in. I'm not sure if it's a good solution, and I'd be happy to hear alternative proposals. (Other people's opinions are also welcome :)\n\nThere are currently 3 broken tests that require changes in activerecord-deprecated_finders in order to pass. I'll do that if we decide to pull this in.\n\nCommit message below:\n\n-------\n\nAt present, ActiveRecord::Delegation compiles delegation methods on a\nglobal basis. The compiled methods apply to all subsequent Relation\ninstances. This creates several problems:\n\n1) After Post.all.recent has been called, User.all.respond_to?(:recent)\n   will be true, even if User.all.recent will actually raise an error due\n   to no User.recent method existing. (See #8080.)\n\n2) Depending on the AR class, the delegation should do different things.\n   For example, if a Post.zip method exists, then Post.all.zip should call\n   it. But this will then result in User.zip being called by a subsequent\n   User.all.zip, even if User.zip does not exist, when in fact\n   User.all.zip should call User.all.to_a.zip. (There are various\n   variants of this problem.)\n\nWe are creating these compiled delegations in order to avoid method\nmissing and to avoid repeating logic on each invocation.\n\nOne way of handling these issues is to add additional checks in various\nplaces to ensure we're doing the \"right thing\". However, this makes the\ncompiled methods signficantly slower. In which case, there's almost no\npoint in avoiding method_missing at all. (See #8127 for a proposed\nsolution which takes this approach.)\n\nThis is an alternative approach which involves creating a subclass of\nActiveRecord::Relation for each AR class represented. So, with this\npatch, Post.all.class != User.all.class. This means that the delegations\nare compiled for and only apply to a single AR class. A compiled method\nfor Post.all will not be invoked from User.all.\n\nThis solves the above issues without incurring significant performance\npenalties. It's designed to be relatively seamless, however the downside\nis a bit of complexity and potentially confusion for a user who thinks\nthat Post.all and User.all should be instances of the same class.\n\nBenchmark\n---------\n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'active_record'\nrequire 'benchmark/ips'\n\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n  establish_connection adapter: 'sqlite3', database: ':memory:'\n  connection.create_table :posts\n\n  def self.omg\n    :omg\n  end\nend\n\nrelation = Post.all\n\nBenchmark.ips do |r|\n  r.report('delegation')   { relation.omg }\n  r.report('constructing') { Post.all }\nend\n```\n\nBefore\n------\n\n```\nCalculating -------------------------------------\n          delegation      4392 i/100ms\n        constructing      4780 i/100ms\n-------------------------------------------------\n          delegation   144235.9 (±27.7%) i/s -     663192 in   5.038075s\n        constructing   182015.5 (±21.2%) i/s -     850840 in   5.005364s\n```\n\nAfter\n-----\n\n```\nCalculating -------------------------------------\n          delegation      6677 i/100ms\n        constructing      6260 i/100ms\n-------------------------------------------------\n          delegation   166828.2 (±34.2%) i/s -     754501 in   5.001430s\n        constructing   116575.5 (±18.6%) i/s -     563400 in   5.036690s\n```\n\nComments\n--------\n\nBear in mind that the standard deviations in the above are huge, so we\ncan't compare the numbers too directly. However, we can conclude that\nRelation construction has become a little slower (as we'd expect), but\nnot by a huge huge amount, and we can still construct a large number of\nRelations quite quickly.",
