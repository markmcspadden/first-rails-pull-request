    "body": "This ensures that developers won't forget to add assets to `config.assets.precompile` while they are developing. It's currently possible to have a site that works fine in development, but raises `AssetNotPrecompiledError` in production because an asset hasn't been compiled. This has happened to me a few times. I think it would be much better if an exception could be raised when an included asset doesn't match a filter in `config.assets.precompile`. I have added a `config.assets.enforce_precompile` option that enables this behavior for `javascript_include_tag` and `stylesheet_link_tag`.\n\nIn order for this to work, `config.assets.precompile` has to be defined in `config/application.rb`, since it needs to be shared across development and production.\n\nThis pull request is a proof of concept, but please let me know if you think it's a good idea. Thanks!",

    "body": "Hash.from_xml was very complicated, and so we decided to take a stab at\nrefactoring it. This is a work in progress that we want to get feedback on.\n\nBasically, instead of defining a huge method on Hash, we made a utility\nobject for actually doing the conversion. This let us break up the big\nmethod into a bunch of smaller ones, so that the process overall is\neasier to understand.\n\nHowever, some of the names kinda suck. Still working on that. But we\nwanted to get some feedback on if this kind of change is generally\nconsidered to be better or not before putting more effort into\nbreaking it up. We think that a bunch of small methods are easier to understand\nthan one massive one.\n\nThings to work on:\n\n* Names. {process,convert} is awkward. And there's also typecast/to.\n* Might be another utility object as well, as half of the class is for refining\n  a Hash that's getting converted.\n* We may have uncovered either missing test cases or extraneous conditions\n  in a few of the if statements. We've left some comments. Tests pass if\n  you remove them, but we didn't want to before confirming that they\n  aren't actually needed.\n* Changes to documentation, including `# :nodoc:` where appropriate\n\n:heart:\n\n- @steveklabnik & @kytrinyx",

    "body": "This is an alternative implementation to #7771 thanks to the advice of @spastorino\n\nRails is a dynamic framework that serves a static index.html by default. One of my first questions ever on IRC was solved by simply deleting my public/index.html file. This file is a source of confusion when starting as it over-rides any set \"root\" in the routes yet it itself is not listed in the routes. By making the page dynamic by default we can eliminate this confusion.\n\nThis PR moves the static index page to an internal controller/route/view similar to `rails/info`. When someone starts a rails server, if no root is defined, this route will take over and the \"dynamic\" index page from rails/welcome_controller will be rendered. These routes are only added in development. If a developer defines a root in their routes, it automatically takes precedence over this route and will be rendered, with no deleting of files required. \n\nIn addition to removing this source of confusion for new devs, we can now use Rails view helpers to build and render this page. While not the primary intent, the added value of \"dogfooding\" should not be under-estimated.\n\nThe prior PR #7771 had push-back since it introduced developer facing files. This PR solves all of the same problems, but does not have any new developer facing files (it actually removes one). \n\ncc/ @wsouto, @dickeyxxx, @tyre, @ryanb, @josevalim, @maxim, @subdigital, @steveklabnik\n\nATP Railties and Actionpack.",

This led to bugs when `mail()` was not the last call in the mailer method.\n\nI re-introduced the `@mail_was_called` flag to check wether `mail()` was actually called. The return value of the mailer method is ignored.\n\nThis needs a backport to `3-2-stable` where the flag `@mail_was_called` is already present.",

Basically, AR was using the where clause but not bothering to join the table, resulting in SQL errors.\n\nAfter I fixed that, I found another bug where using `update_all()` on an ambiguous column name (in the mysql adaptor) resulted in more SQL errors. So I reproduced that in a test and fixed it too.\n\nFeedback welcome. Let me know if it's unclear what I'm trying to do with the tests that I wrote.",

Modern Ruby code should definitely be using this method.\n\nWith this PR there are, to my knowledge, no more occurrences of the old way of flattening a ```#map```.",
