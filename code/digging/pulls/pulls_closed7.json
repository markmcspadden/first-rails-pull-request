    "body": "It's often the case that when you have an association and you only want to append an ActiveRecord object to the association if that association does not already hold your object. For example, consider the case where you have the following setup:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Blackboard\r\n  belongs_to :classroom\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Classroom\r\n  has_many :blackboards\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's say you just obtained a blackboard object from the params hash. If you want to make sure that the blackboard object is in the ``@classroom.blackboards`` association only once, you have to do a manual check to make sure you don't add it a second time.\r\n\r\n```ruby \r\nblackboard = Blackboard.find(params[:id])\r\nblackboard.modify_in_some_way!\r\n\r\nunless @classroom.blackboards.include?(blackboard)\r\n   @classroom.blackboards << blackboard\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new function I added allows you to boil the code down to:\r\n```ruby\r\n@classroom.blackboards.push_if_absent(blackboard)\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Right now, the HTML sanitizer is incredibly hard to read. This PR is a small step towards making it better. \r\n\r\nA lot of the code that was used in the ``Selector`` class was repeated. I've refactored some of this code into new protected helper methods. The ``concatenate_subset_to_matches!`` method refactors code that was basically copy and pasted in 3 different locations. \r\n\r\nI've also changed some ``for`` loops into ``each`` blocks, since in ``for`` loops, the iterator variable persists after the loop has been completed. There's no reason to do this in the ``match`` method (since those variables aren't used later).",

    "body": "This allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for\r\n`ActionController`:\r\n\r\n    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter\r\n\r\nPreviously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks\r\nin `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object\r\nfilter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on\r\n`@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`.\r\nSo, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to\r\nremove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter\r\nobject and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.",

    "body": "This issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10019 cropped up after I made the following change: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/840ca09.  The change makes it so that if the ``:inverse_of`` option is specified on an association, then ActiveRecord will first check the in-memory association cache for the record before going to the database when ``find()`` is called. However, this not longer throws a ``RecordNotFound`` exception.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'm changing the behavior so that ``RecordNotFound`` is thrown in the correct circumstances. I've also refactored the code in the ``FindersMethod`` module so that it can be reused in the new check I've made.",

I think the few extra hashes created during migrations are well worth not breaking 3rd-party code that relies on the Hash assumption, and I hope that you will agree with me.\r\n\r\nExample of broken plugin: https://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-postgis-adapter/pull/60\r\n\r\nI hope the test I added is alright, and I'll be happy to change it based on feedback.",
