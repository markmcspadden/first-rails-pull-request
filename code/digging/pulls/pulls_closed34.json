If so, what is the purpose?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      def test_change_type_of_not_null_column\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => false\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => false\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => true\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n2.) the FIXME in `rename_column` said: \"we should test that the index goes away\". Should the index go away when we rename? Currently it stays as is. Should the index be renamed if the name was generated by rails?\r\n\r\n3.) the FIXME in `test_remove_column_with_multi_column_index` said: \"we should test that the index goes away\". Currently only PostgreSQL drops the index. Both MySQL and SQLite keep the index. Should I write the test for postgres only?\r\n",

    "body": "In my app I use STI and overridden table_name but `habtm` in it doesn't work properly, and I have to set options on it forcibly. I'll show you example:\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Namespace\r\n  class Base < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    self.table_name = 'tablename'\r\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :somethings\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Namespace::Child < Namespace::Base\r\nend\r\n```\r\nIt gives me advantage I can keep all these stuff inside `namespace` directory and it will be auto loaded by AS and it's still STI. But HABTM relies on classes when it calculates table names, so for join table it chooses `bases_somethings` instead of `tablename_somethings`. Of course I can set these options manually and it will work. I left comment in this PR and it has small refactoring proposed by @jonleighton in comment and actually this refactoring is the way to go if we want to use table_name.",

    "body": "The source was this issue #8264\r\n\r\n### the problem\r\n\r\nWhen creating an index the length is verified against the database limit. This allows you to create an index with a name that uses up all available characters.\r\n\r\nWe have internal operations, which rely on prefixing the index to circumvent name collisions. These internal functions will fail when dealing with long indices (`prefix + index name > database limit`).\r\n\r\n### proposed solution\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions.\r\n\r\n1. We can get rid of the internal functionality that relies on prefixing\r\n1. We reserve a range of characters, which rails can use to perform transformations\r\n\r\nSince I'm not sure what impact 1.) would have and if it is even possible I did a draft of 2.)\r\n\r\n### up for discussion\r\n\r\nThere are already methods, which hold the maximum allows characters for index names, column names, table names, etc.. (`index_name_length`, `column_name_length`, `table_name_length`). I'm not sure if we should subtract the reserved character count directly from these lengths.\r\n\r\n* + If we subtract the reserved count directly we need much fewer modifications\r\n* - we loose the actual database limit\r\n\r\nCurrently I only applied the changes to the index names. I think table names and possible column names are affected as well.\r\n\r\n### current solution\r\n\r\nSome adapter (SQLite3) need to perform renaming operations to support the rails DDL. These rename prefixes operate with prefixes. When an index name already uses up the full space provieded by `index_name_length` these internal operations will fail. This patch introduces `allowed_index_name_length` which respects the amount of characters used for internal operations. It will always be <= `index_name_length` and every adapter can define how many characters need to be reserved.",

This patch adds the deprecation warning when a new `BufferedLogger` is instantiated.\r\n\r\nI think this should be enough to show the user every use of the `BufferedLogger`. At some point there must be an instantiation or a subclass definition. This is when a deprecation warning will be shown and these are the places that need modification.\r\n\r\nI did not add deprecation warnings to every instance method because I think this would pollute the log and would not help to track down the problematic areas.",

There could be applications using BufferedLogger instances and I think this should also result in deprecation warnings.

    "body": "On this Festivus day—the fourth anniversary of [the announcement of the merger of Merb into Rails](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3/)—I'd like to reintroduce one of my favorite features from Merb that never made it into Rails 3: action arguments. This feature gives users the ability to define controller actions with parameters that take the values of keys in the `params` hash of the same name. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass PostsController < ApplicationController\r\n\r\n  # Without action arguments\r\n  def destroy\r\n    @post = Post.find(params[:id])\r\n    @post.destroy\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # With action arguments\r\n  def destroy(id)\r\n    @post = Post.find(id)\r\n    @post.destroy\r\n  end\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this syntax is more concise, more Ruby-like, and more explicit than fetching values out of a big `params` hash (of course, `params` is still there for users who need it…as is the whole `request` object).\r\n\r\nI believe this feature pairs particularly nicely with the introduction of strong parameters in Rails 4, since specifying an action argument is also a shorthand for specifying a required parameter.\r\n\r\nIn Merb, which supported Ruby 1.8, the implementation of this feature required some black magic. Today, this feature can be implemented cleanly using the `Method#parameters`, which was added to Ruby 1.9 for just this purpose.\r\n\r\n:santa::christmas_tree::gift:",
