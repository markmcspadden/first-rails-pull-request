    "body": "These extra runs were used to test identity map and not fully removed when the feature was removed.\n\nWhen identity map was removed, ci/travis.rb was updated to remove the line in the if build.activerecord? clause that sets the :identity_map build option to true.  However, the entire if build.activerecord? clause needs to be removed to remove the extra build.run! inside the clause.\n\nCurrently, for each database, activerecord tests are run 4 times, twice not in isolation, and twice in isolation.  They only need to be run twice, once not in isolation, and once in isolation. \n\nTo validate the fix, I have run ci/travis.rb against all the variations of the GEM environment variable as specified in .travis.yml.  All tests ran successfully and there were no duplicate runs.  I ran the tests using ruby 1.9.3 in a vagrant box provisioned based on the same travis cookbook recipes that the travis standard worker box uses.\n\nPlease let me know any more work I need to do for this fix.",

But I get 55 instead :smile:. This is because of modification of `options` variable, which passed in `super`\n\nI've tested it with rails 3.2, 3.0.9 and latest master. With ActiveRecord and MongoMapper.\n\n",

    "body": "*Edit: see my comment below for a more general version of this problem/fix.*\n\nCurrently, `apply_inflections` does not take into account that the input might be a multi-word string separated by underscore. (`tableize` etc relies on this behavior to work correctly.) This bug affects only uncountable multi-word strings separated by underscores:\n\n```ruby\n   \"funky jeans\".singularize # => \"funky jeans\"\n   \"client information\".pluralize # => \"client information\"\n\n   \"funky_jeans\".singularize # => \"funky_jean\"\n   \"client_information\".pluralize # => \"client_informations\"\n```\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that `\"funky_jeans\".singularize` used to work correctly before 9b4622a483319f3d1e7f4489442f0d86afb6da36, which was merged almost 2 years ago so this is essentially broken since Rails 3.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that `\"client_information\".pluralize` has always been broken, so this does change the behavior of `tableize` and could potentially break some older apps out there.\n\nCloses #7132.",
