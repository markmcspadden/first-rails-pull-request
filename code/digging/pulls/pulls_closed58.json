    "body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI found this weird behavior when I was programming during my day job. This is the scenario:\n\n```` ruby\nclass User\n  has_many :tasks\nend\n````\n\n```` ruby\nclass Task\n  belongs_to :user\nend\n````\n\nso I was building a part of the application, and I made the following mistake, passing a object to the integer field:\n\n```` ruby\nt = Task.new\nt.user_id = user\nt.user_id\n=> 1 \n````\n\nwhenever this code runs, the user_id always became 1, not raising a error or anything. So I took a look in the rails source, and found that this behavior is fixed in rails master, but not in the 3.2 tree. \n\nI think this could be considered a bug, so I did this patch. What you guys think?",

    "body": "Hi everybody, I've changed a bit a couple of lines in the Upgrading Ruby on Rails guide:\n\n- Using <ruby> syntax for unicode character routes example instead of\n  `<tt>` since it causes single quotes to be transformed into inverted\n  commas. This makes this required change more eye-catching.\n- Using `<tt>` for the j alias and related helpers as written in the\n  documentation guidelines.\n\nIn particular the second point is the reason for a PR instead of a push in the docrails guide, in the current version of the guide inverted commas are used for code, maybe there was a reason for that (e.g. \"j\" is very short)?\n\nPS: The guide isn't valid because another markup issue that I've already fixed in docrails: https://github.com/lifo/docrails/commit/70d2d2ced44941162e13cb66125482ebf9097ff4",

    "body": "I did a poll on Twitter to see what parts of Rails needed documentation the most, and one glaring thing that was pointed out was how out of date the AJAX guide was.\n\nCurrently, this request is not ready to be merged, but I wanted to get some feedback on what I plan to do before I bother to write the entire thing.\n\nBasically, I built a new outline, and threw a quick paragraph or two together for a bunch of the parts.\n\nCurrent guide (NOT the one I'm working on) is [here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/ajax_on_rails.html), for reference.\n\n## Questions\n\nSome specific feedback I'd like addressed before I flesh this out more:\n\n### Intro to AJAX\n\nWhen this guide was written, AJAX was a bit newer of a technique. The original guide had an explanation of what AJAX is. Now that everybody knows what's up, do we still need this?\n\n### library coverage\n\nI plan on (and have in the outline) linking to a bunch of different projects that are used for testing JS, for example. Is the 'give a bunch of them a paragraph and a link' something we want here?\n\n### SPAs?\n\nI wrote up a little section mentioning Ember, Backbone, and Throne of JS. Obviously, \"How to write a heavy JS app\" is out of the scope of this guide, but I felt that mentioning tools that people can transition to once they get a lot of JS going would make sense. Is this useful?\n\n/cc @fxn @radar @wycats @dhh",
