    "body": "When a new client accesses an app, `session[:session_id]` will return `nil`,\r\nsince no session cookie was sent and no session is created until an attempt\r\nis made to _write_ to the session hash. This patch simply forces a session\r\nto be created if `session[:session_id]` is requested and no session exists.\r\n\r\nA google search will show there are many who wish to access this - perhaps\r\nfor logging, or associating other records (although, I agree it's better to\r\nsimply store an associated record id _in_ the session). The most prevalent\r\nanswer seems to be to use `request.session_options[:id]`. However, I believe\r\n`session[:session_id]` is now the preferred method of obtaining this.\r\nNote that with this patch, the former will still return `nil` if no session exists.\r\n\r\nHowever, when `session[:session_id]` is requested, I believe most developers\r\nwould not expect this to return `nil`. If they wish to know whether or not\r\na session already exists, they should use `session.exists?`. Otherwise, I\r\nbelieve they expect to get the session id for the current session - whether\r\nor not the session is new or not.\r\n\r\nNote that using `protect_from_forgery` will cause the authenticity token to\r\nbe written to the session (and therefore create a session if none exists),\r\nhowever this is not done until templates are rendered. Since this is the\r\ndefault - and this patch would only cause session creation if `session[:session_id]`\r\nis requested - I don't see any impact on session laziness.\r\n\r\n",

In the end, the hash looks like:\r\n\r\n  { :encoding => 'utf8', 'encoding' => 'latin1' }\r\n\r\nThe call to options.symbolize_keys calls to_sym on each_key of this\r\nHash. It usually means that the encoding passed overwrites the default\r\nutf8, but it's not guaranteed. So, we shouldn't rely on it.\r\n\r\nThe same was happening in ActiveRecord::ConnectionHandling.",

    "body": "When `ActionController::ParameterMissing` is raised, the following occurred before this pull-request:\r\n\r\n* In development, the following error message is rendered to the response body: `\"Required parameter missing: foo\"`. But no backtrace is displayed in the browser or the logs.\r\n* In production, the same error messages is rendered to the response body. This exposes the user to confusing developer-speak. Also, exception notifiers won't notify the developer of the issue since the exception is eaten by `rescue_from`.\r\n\r\nAfter this pull-request, the following will occur:\r\n\r\n* In development, the Rails exception page will be rendered, complete with backtrace and code snippet showing offending line.\r\n* In production, the appropriate error page is rendered.\r\n\r\nI didn't change the response code; it's still `400`. Since a default Rails app doesn't include a `400.html` file, an empty response body will be rendered by default in production.\r\n\r\nPossibly we could change the response code to `422`? It seems like an appropriate code and Rails generates a `422.html` by default.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Especially since last week's issue in fact did result in a new 2.3 gem.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes all the necessary preparations, all you need to do is build and push.",

There are two engines with migrations, where one engine depends on having a database table created in a migration in another engine. Unfortunately, \"railties:install:migrations\" task does not respect the order of engines that one can configure via \"Rails.application.config.railties_order\". This simple commit fixes that by using \"ordered_railties\" instead of \"railties\" (and thus the migration files are copied to the main application in the correct order).",

    "body": "After the Rails server ran for long enough, Chome started returning a `net::ERR_RESPONSE_HEADERS_TOO_BIG` error on every page load, and curl would error with `curl: (27) Avoided giant realloc for header (max is 102400)!`. A server restart would reset the headers and made the problem temporarily go away.\r\n\r\nInvestigating showed that the same `IE=Edge,` headers were being appended on every request until finally the header size exceeded the 100k limit that browsers impose. \r\n\r\nThis patch ensures that the IE=Edge and other header variables only get appended to the X-UA-Compatible header if they are not there already, and it makes the test pass that I modified to catch the problem.\r\n\r\nThe commit that introduced this problem (d8c1404107501e131e4c7c653794768f5c461793, @nikitug) was applied to both master and 3-2-stable, so this fix should be backported to 3-2-stable as well.",
