    "body": "It was decided two year ago in c96a505391 that \"update_attribute should not update readonly attributes\". I believe it's missleading and should be changed.\n\nI wrote an issue asking whether it's normal or not: rails/rails/issues/7679. As you can see, it was recommended to me to try sending pull request.\n\nReasons I believe `update_attribute`, `update_column` and `update_columns` should update readonly attributes:\n\n 1. All validations are skipped in this methods. Readonly check really looks like validation.\n 2. `update_attribute` is kind of more 'raw' version of `=` operator, but in this case I can do\n\n ```ruby\n minivan.color = 'new_color'\n minivan.save\n ```\n\n without getting exceptions, but can't do\n\n ```ruby\n minivan.update_attribute :color, 'new_color'\n ```\n\n It's pretty weird, in this case `=` behaves more raw than `update_attribute`.\n\n 3. Readonly control is relatively low-level:\n\n ```ruby\n # Filters the primary keys and readonly attributes from the attribute names.\n def attributes_for_update(attribute_names)\n   attribute_names.select do |name|\n     column_for_attribute(name) && !pk_attribute?(name) && !readonly_attribute?(name)\n   end\n end\n ```\n And here is one more oddity: we don't raise exception for `pk_attribute`, but do for `readonly_attribute` in `update_attribute`, `update_column` and `update_columns`.\n\nI'm open for discussion. Please, let me know where I'm wrong :)\n\n  \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Backport of applicable parts of #6441 cb6f83935, in a backwards compatible way. \n\nPreviously, ConnectionPool uses connection spec key 'wait_timeout' (default 5 seconds) to decide how long a thread can block waiting for a connection to be avail before raising. \n\nHowever, mysql2 adapter uses this same 'wait_timeout' key for an entirely different value -- setting the MySQL server's own 'wait timeout', how long the server will allow a connection to be idle before closing it. Default is several hours. \n\nExtreme differences in default shows you often do not want these two values to be the same. But if you don't want them to be default, there is no supported API to change one without changing the other to be the same, since they both use 'wait_timeout'. \n\nSo this change maeks ConnectionPool use `checkout_timeout` in the spec, prefering it over `wait_timeout`.  But `wait_timeout` IS (unlike in master) still used if there without `checkout_timeout`.  If you want mysql2's `wait_timeout` to be differnet than ConnectionPool's timeout, you can (and have to) set them both -- mysql2 will use the `wait_timeout`, ConnectionPool will use the `checkout_timeout`.  But prior to this patch there was _no_ way to do that. \n\nThe actual code change is very straightforward. But I wasn't sure how to write the test. The test is a bit wonky, if someone has a suggestion of how to organize the test better, please do share. @rafaelfranca  , any interest/feedback?",

    "body": "There are a number of issues I've seen repeatedly come up in github issues I think we can fix by having them in this file. From minor issues like improper whitespace, to major ones like bug fixes and features getting abandoned because authors don't know how to properly rebase or squash. \n\nWhile we already have a large amount of contribution information no http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html it still requires a user to click through and read the guide. My experience with readme's and wiki's on github is that most users expect the readme to summarize all topics, and any additional links to expand on them. Similarly it would be beneficial to our potential contributors to have all this information available at a glance on the contribution guide.\n\nInspiration for additional information from: http://contribute.md/ and @hone\n\nFor a preview check out: https://github.com/schneems/rails/blob/schneems/contribute/CONTRIBUTING.md",

    "body": "In master, @pmahoney's 02b2335563 causes contention for connections in the ConnectionPool to be fair (first-waiting, first-satisfied) which is important for reasonable behavior in a high-contention short-checkout scenario.  See also issue #6492 .\n\nI have been using a hacky local monkey patched backport of that patch in my rails 3.2.x app for several months now -- and it's performing admirably.  My app that had so much trouble in rails 3.2.x in the sorts of scenarios the patch is designed to fix -- now runs awesomely, as expected. \n\nSo I think it's valuable to backport this to 3-2-stable. (A couple others have asked me about these issues in 3.2).  Which is what this pull request is. \n\nI manually prepared the backport -- master had enough other semantic and implementation diffs from 3-2-stable that it was a bit tricky to figure out the right way to do this (and this stuff is confusing). But I think I got it right. \n\nNote one significant difference in this backport patch from master:  3-2 still tries to rescue 'leaked' connections in #checkout, if no connections are available, `clear_stale_cached_connections!` is called. This behavior is still preserved with this backport in 3-2-stable, adding the `clear_stale_cached_connections!` check in the new `acquire_connection`. (When I forgot to do this, I indeed got failing tests in 3-2-stable `test_checkout_behaviour`, which passed again when I made sure `clear_stale_cached_connections!` still happened when required). \n\nI am relatively confident I've gotten everything right, although this stuff is admittedly quite tricky. \n\n@tenderlove, @rafaelfranca or anyone else with eyes on AR, appreciate feedback and/or merge, thanks!

So, I've to convert those to Github Flavored Markdown, to make it consistent with other documentations on the site. This will make us having to write documentation only in RDoc and Markdown and also lower a barrier of entry for guide editors, as it seems like contributors nowadays will know how to use GFM more than Textile.\n\nThe generated version of the guide is currently at https://dl.dropbox.com/u/506761/output/index.html. \n\n**NOTE:** There might be some places that the style might still be broken. However, I think it have reaches the point that I want to merge this in first and follow up with the style changes, as there're so many merge conflicts that came up after I rebased it tonight. I'd still say it's ~99% done though. I also want to get it in because guides are changed so frequent, so the faster the better. :P\n\n/cc @fxn, @vijaydev for a review.",

The `ExceptionWrapper` used the following lookup machanics:\n\n```ruby\nRack::Utils.status_code(@@rescue_responses[@exception.class.name])\n```\n\nwhich resulted in a lookup for `'Array'` and eventually in a 500.\n\nTo fix the bug I did:\n\n* Added a test to `log_subscriber_test` in actionpack (I used a different exception class because `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` is not available but they share the same problem)\n* Change the lookup in `LogSubscriber` to use the `rescue_responses` hash directly (because I don't have an Exception instance)",
