Perhaps this could be achieved by implicitly calling reset_column_information after each schema change.  However, I don't care too much about that behaviour - I'd be just as happy with getting NoMethodError on trying to assign to 'body'.  We were caught out and lost some production data because the model update appeared to work fine, when it was actually just dropping the values assigned to it.\n\nSee https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6679 for prior discussion.",

This commit adds rdoc for #where, based on both the Rails Guide and a perusal of the Active Record test suite. I'm opening a pull request, rather than just committing to docrails, because I want some input on style and substance for documenting this important method.\n\nI also found examples in the test suite of condition templates like this:\n\n    User.where(\"field = '%s'\", \"value\")\n\nI don't see this printf-style mentioned anywhere in the guides or other external documentation; I'm wondering if it's still valid/considered in good taste. If it is, then I'd appreciate a pointer to which %-escapes are supported.\n\n",

    "body": "When new programmers push their code to a production server and receive an error they often don't know to check the logs, this simple reminder will help. Most professional applications have custom error pages so this change shouldn't affect them. The wording of the message should not confuse non-developer visitors.\n\nI run into this while going through getting started tutorials like Rails Girls: http://guides.railsgirls.com/heroku/ with users. Specifically when users push their code to Heroku and then don't migrate their databases. They're often confused about what to do next and won't instinctively check the logs without someone else telling them to. Hopefully this should help.\n\nScreenshot of 404: http://cl.ly/3j1S0k3I3K292u3x2q3K\n\n\n",

    "body": "What \n====\n\nI propose reverting to the old implementation of `ActiveRecord#attributes` (changed in c4809d9984ab5d20759075a96ddea6096ab93802).\n\nWhy\n====\nThe current way that `attributes` builds its attributes hash creates `(n * 2) + 1` extraneous arrays, where `n` is the number of attribute keys. Switching back to the old implementation reduces this to 0.\n\nFor instance, I have a model with 43 columns; with Memprof (on 1.8.7) we can see that `attributes` normally creates 87 Arrays because of the `map` usage:\n\n```\n1.8.7 :010 > Memprof.track { my_record.attributes }\n     87 /.../activerecord-3.2.5/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:184:Array\n      1 /.../activerecord-3.2.5/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:184:__node__\n      1 /.../activerecord-3.2.5/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:184:Hash\n```\n\nNow when we switch back to the original implementation that builds a hash with `each` (despite having 2 more LOC), we can see the benefit:\n\n```\n1.8.7 :010 > Memprof.track { my_record.attributes }\n      1 /.../activerecord-3.2.5/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:184:Hash\n      1 /.../activerecord-3.2.5/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:179:Array\n```\n\nI didn't verify the object count in 1.9 myself, but I did a 1.9 GC profile and confirmed that GC did run fewer times overall with this change (over a large sample).\n\nNote\n====\nafaik, `attributes` isn't actually used that often, however `serializable_hash` uses it. Since `serializable_hash` would most likely be used in apis where it's common to return lists of many records, it seems worthy of optimizing this method.",

This fixes that problem by checking :pk_and_sequence_for, then\n:primary_key.\n\nNot sure how to go about testing this - it's easy to get into this state in a DB like postgres\nby creating a table with a normal sequence ID, then later migrating to drop that ID and\ncreate a new primary key column of e.g. varchar. None of the other tests seem to do\nanything like that, though, so I thought I'd ask before venturing out myself.\n",

Django applications use a `password` column for digest), conflicting plugins ",

Needed to depend on SQL-ignoring instead.\n\nSome tests thought they knew exactly how many queries the connection adapter would perform in order to retrieve metadata, but the assumptions were unwarranted. Needed to assert >=1 queries vs no queries around specific statements instead.",
