Since I see all the other changes have credit attributed I would like to include credit to myself and Egor Homakov who described the issue.\r\nI'm not sure what the best way to do this is, so that it would not be a single commit just for this, perhaps the next time the ActiveModel changelog is changed?\r\nJust in case I am attaching a pull request.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the trouble :S\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJan",

(Most often different width.) Unfortunately date_select helper don't provide possibility to set different CSS classes. This commit extend date_select helper with option :css_by_type that set special classes for generated 'select' tags. Class names equal data type, for example:\r\nf.date_select :birthday, :css_by_type => true\r\ngenerate:\r\n```\r\n<select class='month ...>...</select>\r\n<select class='day' ...>...</select>\r\n<select class='year' ...>...</select>\r\n```\r\nHope it will by helpfully.\r\n",

    "body": "This has been bugging me forever.\r\n\r\nI have a few packaged asset gems that have other loose files under their load path like README.mds. Those get copied over and digested to `public/assets`. This happens more often with bower packages.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that these libraries have many optional parts. You don't always want all the images and other stuff copied over unless you say so.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting that we only auto compile \"loose\" files under `app/asset` paths. This would include railtie gems. So if you do `app/assets` in your gem, those are auto included. `lib/assets` and `vendor/assets` are by hand. I think that this models Rails' default autoloading strategy of `app/` is autoloaded and autorequired, while `lib/` and `vendor/` have to be explicit.\r\n\r\nDepends on #7964 being merged first.\r\n\r\n/cc @dhh \r\n",

Blobs require extra care when used as keys in indexes, and have some performance caveats [1].\r\n\r\nThis change uses `varbinary` for `binary` columns that specify a `limit` <= 255 bytes. The test changes indirectly verify the code, as the `add_index` statement fails if the `tiny_blob` column uses a blob type. I can add a direct test if that is desirable.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this pull request!\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/blob.html ",
