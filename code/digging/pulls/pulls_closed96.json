Previously, `redirect_to` required explicit parentheses and braces:\r\n\r\n    # Redirect to url\r\n    redirect_to post_url(@post), status: 301\r\n    redirect_to post_url(@post), status: 302, notice: \"We've temporarily moved!\"\r\n    \r\n    # Redirect to controller action\r\n    redirect_to action: 'atom', status: 301\r\n    redirect_to({action: 'atom'}, status: 302, notice: \"We're temporarily moved!\")\r\n    redirect_to({action: 'atom', status: 302}, notice: \"We're temporarily moved!\")\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we could pull flash options from the action hash, as we currently do for the status option, leaving us with the syntax:\r\n\r\n    redirect_to action: 'atom', status: 302, notice: \"We're temporarily moved!\"\r\n\r\nThis change would be backwards compatible with the exception of anyone using `:notice', ':alert', or ':flash' as action hash keys to provide query string parameters or something.
