However, if an object updates its foreign key and removes itself from an association, the counter cache will not update correctly.\r\n\r\nI've included a ``before_save`` callback that increments or decrements the counter if the foreign key gets changed in a ``belongs_to`` association. If the foreign key was present before but is no longer present after the update, then the counter gets decremented. Likewise, if the foreign key was not present before but is present after the update, then the counter gets incremented.\r\n\r\nThe counter cache only gets changed if the record is not new (so it doesn't conflict with the ``after_create`` callback currently in place.",

As some of us are still using XML I thought that I could prepare proof of concept of such method and see if it is good idea.\r\n\r\nIt's current state is far from perfect(not to mention lack of tests), but my main idea is to ask if I'm going in right direction? If so I would gladly improve code base and write more tests, but right now I could use some sanity check and opinions from more experienced Rails core developers about way I'm trying to do that.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective the biggest gain would be calling methods like `render :xml => true` - in some cases that could be useful and this is allowed in XML spec, but I'm not sure if it will not break something.",

The data can be accessed using both formats and the integration testing API no makes use of `Http::Headers`.\r\n\r\nSince not all headers are prefixed with \"HTTP_\" in the env format I had to add a whitelist. I don't think the whitelist is complete so please let me know if I should add more.\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem described in #6513",

Getting the migration, model, views, tests, and fixtures correct is needlessly complicated.  This change enables application developers to specify password:digest on a generate scaffold command.  Doing so:\r\n\r\n* adds password_digest attribute to the migration\r\n* adds has_secure_password to the model\r\n* adds password and password_confirmation password_fields to _form.html\r\n* <del>adds password_digest to index.html and show.html</del>\r\n* adds password and password_confirmation to the controller\r\n* adds unencrypted password and password_confirmation to the controller test\r\n* adds encrypted password_digest to the fixture\r\n\r\nThe following tests have been run and pass successfully:\r\n\r\n    TEST_DIR=generators bundle exec rake test\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the __unmodified__ Agile Web Development with Rails tests have been run (i.e., they haven't been updated to use this new option), and I've verified that absolutely no change to any of the generated artefacts results by this change.\r\n\r\nNot done yet: <del>changelog, new tests</del>, jbuilder, and updating the edge guides and the AWDwR tests.\r\n\r\n@steveklabnik, @jeremy, @carlosantoniodasilva",
