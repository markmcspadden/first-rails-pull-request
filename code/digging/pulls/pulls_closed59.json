When I need `JSON` or other format I can of course add `.(:format)` and rails will recognize this. Why is this the only option?\n\n* I do not want nor need to use :format in routes\n* I use jQuery.getJSON method with cross-domain option `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` is not set\n* There is a proper Accept header : `application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.0`\n* There is respond_to `:json` in controller definition\n* I use `respond_with` in action and give it an object that has `to_json` and `as_json` method implemented\n\nWhen I ask for `JSON` rails should respond with `JSON`.",

    "body": "@tenderlove this PR is based on our discussion in #7424\n\nWhen `ActionDispatch::ParamsParser#parse_formatted_parameters` raises an exception, it's re-raised as `ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::ParseError` instead of the original exception - we're assuming that the only thing that can raise an exception there is a parser. This way it's much easier to catch parsing error that originated in `ParamsParser` (skipping parsing errors raised later down the chain e.g. in actions) and return a custom response e.g. 400.\n\nBTW. There's a funky thing going on with request body in `ParamsParser#parse_formatted_parameters` ([link](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb#L37-58)). Proc and Yaml strategies use `request.raw_post` (which reads request body and then rewinds it before being parsed), but JSON and XML ones read and rewind request body on their own e.g.:\n\n```ruby\nwhen :json\n  data = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)\n  request.body.rewind if request.body.respond_to?(:rewind)\n  ...\n```\n\nThe issue is that if JSON.decode raises an exception, request body is not rewinded and thus calling `request.raw_post` later inside the error handler returns nil. Is there any reason why not all strategies use `request.raw_post`? This should most likely fix this issue.",

    "body": "This allows to set a custom response (e.g. 400) when `ParamsParser` raises an exception when parsing request params. One can do it by swapping the default `ActionDispatch::ParamsParser`:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::ParamsParser, \n                       ActionDispatch::ParamsParser, {}, lambda { |e| [400, {}, [\"Bad request\"]]}\n```\n\nThis is still a bit awkward, so it could be further simplified to e.g. \n```ruby\nconfig.action_dispatch.params_parser_error_handler = lambda { ... }\n```\nbut it's not implemented in this patch.\n\nWithout this patch it's of course still possible to return custom response, however slightly more difficult. Here's one of possible solutions:\n\n```ruby\nclass MyParamsParser < ActionDispatch::ParamsParser\n  def call\n    super\n  rescue MultiJson::DecodeError\n    [400, {}, [\"Bad Request\"]]\n  end\nend\n\nconfig.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::ParamsParser, MyParamsParser\n```\n\nThe other question is why Rails doesn't return 400 by default instead of 500 when parsing request params fails :)",

    "body": "When dealing with legacy or read-only databases schemas, sometimes you need to tell Rails to ignore one or more columns.  Or, you have meta-columns that are used by a separate daemon or app, but you don't want them cluttering up your rails app. \n\n`ignore_columns` interfaces cleanly right at the point where the column names are cached by ActiveRecord, using a simple `reject` call.  \n\nThe specific case I built this for was a read-only app on top of an AuthLogic database structure.  AuthLogic uses `respond_to?(:column)` calls throughout to determine whether to enable a certain piece of functionality.  This works great with a 1-app-1-database relationship, but in this case, some functionality needed to be enabled on one app, but not the other: specifically the \"increment failed login count\" module.  `ignore_column :failed_login_count` would be by far the cleanest way to workaround this.\n\nVarious monkey-patches floating around Stack Overflow: \n* [How can I permanently ignore a database column in my ActiveRecord::Base class? — Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911174/how-can-i-permanently-ignore-a-database-column-in-my-activerecordbase-class) \n* [How can I use ActiveRecord on a database that has a column named 'attribute'?
