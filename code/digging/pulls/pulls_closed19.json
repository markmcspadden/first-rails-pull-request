    "body": "- CSRF protection does not only apply to HTML/JS requests anymore (as\n far as I can tell)\n- CSRF protection is still fine to use with API requests and Rails\n supports this scenario through the X-CSRF-Token header. Updated the\n docs to reflect and explain this.\n\nI was going through the API docs for this while configuring Rails to\nwork with AngularJS and noticed that they suggest Rails ignores CSRF\ntokens on non HTML/JS requests. This does not appear to be the case\nanymore.\n\nAlso while I understand the reasons why CSRF is not really an issue for\nAPI requests, it does technically rely on secure implementations of the\nbrowsers (and possibly their plugins) to ensure that a site can't make\nXSS requests via AJAX. Since Rails easily supports submitting the CSRF\ntoken via a header I thought it might be worth adding that API\ndevelopers can do that if they prefer.",

While the backport already included a test for the sqlite adapter I wanted to make sure that we cover the new issue from #9367. Also the added test is not adapter specific so we can lock the behavior for all adapters.\r\n\r\nI would also like to submit another PR containing only the test-case to the master branch.

As you can see from the discussion here:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/BWPUTK7WvYA/discussion\r\nand\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b081f6b59fb3f15d12043072ad9b331ffd2bc56e\r\n\r\nit was originally deprecated in 3.2 and removed in 4.0.  After that, I believe these changes were reverted so as to not deprecate functionality in patch releases:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/81542f95d25825a7d3eff87d6f706661bf553b18\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the intent was still to have it deprecated in 4.0.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds that deprecation.  Please let me know if this is indeed desired, and if so if any changes are needed.\r\n\r\nLikely interested parties: @fxn and @steveklabnik\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nAndrew\r\n",

    "body": "Had a problem today where we had a `belongs_to :connection` on our model. Hadn't occurred to me that this might be a problem, but when we ran our tests we were getting an obscure `undefined method substitute_at for nil:NilClass` exception whenever an instance of this class was being destroyed.\r\n\r\nDiscovered the root cause was this method, which was attempting to call `connection` on the instance, which in turn [delegates to the class](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L328). This seems like a pretty safe change to make, I can't think of any possible repercussions. I wasn't sure if this warranted a regression test, but I'd be happy to provide one if it's required.",
