To ensure this, a js runtime may not be available on the app\r\nservers. In this environment, pages using javascript_include_tag for\r\nassets with non-standard or chained extensions were throwing 500 errors.\r\nFor instance, `javascript_include_tag('jquery.min')` would blow up.\r\n\r\nSprockets was attempting to build the assets being included during the\r\nrewrite_extension step (responsible for appending a '.js' extension to\r\nassets being included by the basename rather than a fully qualified\r\nname). This was happening as a step to resolve #6310, which required\r\nchecking for the presence of an asset with a non-standard extension\r\nbefore appending the extension.\r\n\r\nWe can check for the presence of an asset without invoking the asset\r\nbuild step by using Sprockets' resolve method, which will search for the\r\nbase file without building it (and is the method that find_asset uses\r\ninternally to get the path to the asset before attempting to build it).\r\n\r\nWhen rewriting the extension on an asset, these are the steps:\r\n- If the source does not have an extension, assume that the default\r\n  extension is desired and append it.\r\n- If there is an extension and it doesn't match the default extension,\r\n  check to see if a file with the precise name specified exists amongst\r\n  the assets; if it is present, do not append the default extension.\r\n  (This is the step that resolves #6310).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a new pull of #6729 after github was confused post-rebase.",

    "body": "This is a duplicate of #8718, made against master in preparation for merging. /cc @rafaelfranca\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a bug introduced in 96a13fc7 which breaks behaviour of\r\ninteger fields.\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, setting the value of an integer field to a non-integer (eg.\r\nArray, Hash, etc.) would default to 1 (true) :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n    p.category_id = { 3 => 4 }\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.9 and above, this will raise a NoMethodError :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.9\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `to_i' for [1, 2]:Array\r\n\r\nWhilst at first blush this appear to be sensible, it combines in bad\r\nways with scoping.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is common to use scopes to control access to data :\r\n\r\n    @collection = Posts.where(:category_id => [ 1, 2 ])\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, this would work as expected, creating a new Post object\r\n(albeit with @new_post.category_id = 1). However, in 3.2.9 this will\r\ncause the NoMethodError to be raised as above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to avoid triggering this error without descoping before\r\ncalling .new, breaking any apps running on 3.2.8 that rely on this\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThis patch deviates from 3.2.8 in that it does not retain the somewhat\r\nspurious behaviour of setting the attribute to 1. Instead, it explicitly\r\nsets these invalid values to nil :\r\n\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the situation where a scope using an array will\r\n\"pollute\" any newly instantiated records.\r\n\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n    @new_post.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nFinally, 3.2.8 exhibited a behaviour where setting an object to an\r\ninteger field caused it to be coerced to \"1\". This has not been\r\nretained, as it is spurious and surprising in the same way that setting\r\nArrays and Heshes was :\r\n\r\n    c = Category.find(6)\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\n    # This patch\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis commit includes explicit test cases that expose the original issue\r\nwith calling new on a scope that uses an Array. As this is a common\r\nsituation, an explicit test case is the best way to prevent regressions\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nIt also updates and separates existing tests to be explicit about the\r\nsituation that is being tested (eg. AR objects vs. other objects vs.\r\nnon-integers)",
