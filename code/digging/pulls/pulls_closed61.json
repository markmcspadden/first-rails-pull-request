    "body": "This is preparation before extracting Action View from Action Pack. Initially I went with extracting up-front, but @jeremy advised me to do changes first and then extract when everything is ready (which in fact is much better strategy).\n\nThe commits in this pull request basically get rid of Action Pack classes usage from Action View.\n\nOne of the problems that I want to ask about are deprecation messages. I deprecated 2 things here (moving `RecordIdentifier` to Action View and mime type lookups in auto discovery link tag) to follow rule \"Deprecate in 4.0, remove in 4.1\" instead deprecating in 3.2.x and removing in 4.0, but this means that we will be able to extract Action View no sooner than 4.1. Those deprecations will not be probably hit by many people, so I would like to consider moving them to `3-2-stable`, but I'm not sure about that.\n\n/cc @spastorino @rafaelfranca @josevalim @carlosantoniodasilva",

With the patch, the times are all in sync.\nThis diff should also apply cleanly to 3.2.\n\nCC: @tenderlove, @rafaelfranca ",
