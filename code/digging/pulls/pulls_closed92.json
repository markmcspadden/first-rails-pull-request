    "body": "Support string substitutions in the order clause in ActiveRecord.\r\n\r\nThis helps cases when you want to order on an expression. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 10\r\nMyModel.order(['(id % ?)', value])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it uses a heuristic to distinguish between ordering by a list of values, and a single value that happens to be a string substitution (an sql sanitization). If the first item in an array is a string that contains a question mark, it is assumed that the intent is for that array to be a string substitution. I'm of course open to suggestions on this heuristic.\r\n\r\nThis is also very useful in geospatial queries where the order clause sometimes contains function calls, as in:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nloc = get_location\r\nmax_dist = get_max_dist\r\nMyLocation.order(['st_distance(\"latlon\", ?) < ?', loc, max_dist])\r\n```",

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nSome system clocks, particularly on virtual non-realtime environments can as tick with very low clock resolution. In such an environment the Event#parent_of? method can erroneously conclude that multiple instrumentation events that take place within a single tick are all each other's parents.\r\n\r\nTo work around this I implemented entry and exit counters for instrumentation events. These counters should reset with each transaction.\r\n\r\nI'm not married to this implementation, but I would love to work with you guys on the issue. It's one of the things that is holding us up from implementing the Notifications API in the New Relic Ruby agent.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJon Guymon",
