If it's unable to do so, it should complain about it with an exact reason, at the time of enQ.\r\n\r\nMy take:\r\n\r\nThis problem can't easily be solved exclusively by the framework. Any attempt to do so fully would likely lead to a leaky abstraction wherein Job authors end up digging in to the guts of such an implementation.\r\n\r\nInstead, a simple and minimal contract should exist between Job objects and the framework responsible for enQ-ing and running them.\r\n\r\n1. a run method\r\n2. a serializable_hash method\r\n3. a from_serializable_hash method\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n\r\nBackend job systems should have a choice on how to serialize jobs.  It's fine for Marshal to be the default in Rails, but it's unnecessarily restricting to impose this requirement on all integrators.\r\n\r\n",
