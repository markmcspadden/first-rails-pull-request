Since our\r\nRelation API is close to SQL terms I renamed `#uniq` to `#distinct`.\r\n\r\nThere is no deprecation. `#uniq` and `#uniq!` are aliases and will continue\r\nto work. I also updated the documentation to promote the use of `#distinct`.\r\nc7f94f0\r\n\r\n## 2.\r\n\r\nDeprecate the `:distinct` option for `Relation#count`.\r\nWe moved more and more away from passing options to finder / calculation\r\nmethods. The `:distinct` option in `#count` was one of the remaining places.\r\nSince we can now combine `Relation#distinct` with `Relation#count` the option\r\nis no longer necessary and can be deprecated.",

    "body": "This is a fix for issue #9567\r\nI think that the dependent options should be taken into account only when destroy is called on the \"parent\" of the has_many association. In the issue's example it is the post. When delete_all is called directly on the association it should ignore the dependent option completely but should call the before_add/before_remove callbacks since all existing records will be removed from the collection.\r\n\r\nThis is not the current behaviour and this change could break some existing apps. This PR might needs some additional tests but I wanted to see if you would agree on this first.",
