This object can then be passed around with references, or can be converted to a hash so that its information can easily be passed around as payload in the Notifications system.\r\n\r\nThis change paves the way for creating a better FileUpdateChecker (see https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9259) which will identify which files have been changed and send out a notification using the ``ChangedFile`` class implemented in this PR. However, its a much smaller change than https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9259 so I'm hoping to incorporate it slowly.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I believe the reason ``Railtie::Configurable`` was created was so that the subclasses of the Railtie class would have the methods in the Configurable module (such as ``instance``, ``configure``, and ``method_missing``). However, the implementer of Railtie did not want Railtie itself to have these methods.\r\n\r\nThis was implemented by forcing all modules that inherit from Railtie to include the Configurable module like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Railtie\r\n  class << self\r\n    def inherited(base)\r\n      base.send(:include, Railtie::Configurable)\r\n    end\r\n  ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't great because it forces all the subclasses of Railtie to have this module, which isn't ideal behavior. Instead, it would be nice to use inheritance to make sure these methods appear in subclasses of Railties.\r\n\r\nI've made it so that the Railtie class has the methods from Railtie::Configurable, and that Railtie itself cannot be instantiated and is effectively an abstract class.\r\n",

Of course, you can change the pluralization rules if all your class names will be in spanish, but I found myself having to use quite a lot of irregular plurals for various reasons.\r\n  \r\n",

    "body": "hi everyone,\r\n\r\nMessageBus is a mechanism to push messages from rails server to browser under **development mode**.\r\n\r\nBy default, MessageBus will detect your rails application's file system changes(thanks to    @wangjohn ) and notify your browser the changes(using SSE). This will make you a happier develpment life since you do not need to refresh browser manually \\^_^/.\r\n\r\nMessageBus is a generic solution for message pushing from rails server(and rails console) to browser, you can push any data to the browser. Since your data will be passed through a DRb server, your arbitrary data must follow the requirements of the DRb server.\r\n\r\n## usage\r\nrequire [this Gem](https://github.com/dahakawang/messagebus) to enable the MessageBus in your rails project and you will instantly get file system change notification ability. and you can also send message from you code.\r\n\r\nat present the sse feature is in progress(nearly completed), so the message will be print the message in console (if you specify a debug flag)\r\n\r\n## preview\r\n![preview](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2820550/252254/efb9c758-8b8f-11e2-860c-58b15454b7c2.jpg)\r\n\r\nthe right up is rails app, it received the notification of the file system changes and a message from rails console.",

    "body": "There doesn't seem to be a good reason that ``Rails::Application`` has to be a singleton, other than the fact that the app needs to get initialized somewhere and its convenient to make it a singleton.\r\n\r\n# Overview of Changes\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I've made it so that Rails is no longer a singleton, and multiple applications can be initialized in a single ruby process. The caveat is that these applications will share a single global configuration which is stored in ``Rails.config``, which is created as soon as the first rails application is initialized. \r\n\r\nThis also means that ``Rails.config`` is available before the environment initialization occurs. \r\n\r\n## New Initialization Procedure\r\n\r\nYou can now initialize multiple rails applications. To do this, I've changed the initialization of an application to the following structure (you can see this inside of ``/config/application.rb``). \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Application < Rails::Application\r\nend\r\n\r\nApplication.new do\r\n  config.time_zone = 'Eastern'\r\n  config.blah = 'blah'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that you can call ``Application.new`` as many times as you would like. You don't have to actually create a subclass, and you can just call ``Rails::Application.new``, but creating a subclass is backwards compatible with the way applications have been initialized in the past.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Applications\r\n\r\nWhen you configure an application now, you will be changing a global configuration object stored in ``Rails.config``. You can also configure this directly by doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.configure do |config|\r\n  config.time_zone = 'Eastern'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Global Configuration\r\n\r\nThis PR still uses a global configuration for all rails app. Whenever a new application is created, it's configuration will be the same as the configuration of all the other rails applications. (This global config will be relaxed as I continue to work on this PR. The end goal is to make it so that each application has its own, separate configuration).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the ``Rails`` module stores the global rake tasks. These rake tasks are shared across all applications. \r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI've made sure that this PR preserves a lot of old functionality. Initializing and configuring an application in the old way is still possible. For example: inside ``/config/application.rb`` you can still define an application as follows:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Application < Rails::Application\r\n  config.time_zone = 'Eastern'\r\nend\r\n\r\nApplication.initialize!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call to ``Application.initialize!`` sets ``Rails.application`` to a new instance of ``Application``, but cannot be called twice. \r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\nI've also gotten rid of the ``Railtie::Configurable`` module. This is because it currently forces all children of ``Rails::Railtie`` to include this module, no matter what. This force feeding doesn't seem like good practice, and prevents you from having any say in whether you want the module or not. Moving the guts of the Configurable module inside Railtie itself helps alleviate this issue. ",

    "body": "I'm trying to fix this bug: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder/pull/100\r\n\r\nThe only way I see I can fix that is to redefine the ScaffoldControllerGenerator template and add hooks to it. And to do that I need to require  a lot of code including `rails/generators`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if I do that in jbuilder gem, it'll create `Rails::Configuration::Generators` instance and skip all custom generator settings specified in other gems.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have `jbuilder` and `haml-rails` gems enabled, `jbuilder` requires `rails/generators` just for template/hook, and then, later `haml-rails` is doing `config.generators.template_engine :haml` which never get into `Rails::Generators.options` because it was already initialized earlier.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that it loads a lot of generators code even if generators are not needed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed here, but one solution would be to add load hook for generator. It'll allow me to augment the generator only when it actually loads, which kinda solves both problems stated above.",

It's not obvious they then have to look at the top (as the top is often also out of sight). \r\n\r\nThis patch always shows all time zone options below the separator, even when they are listed as a priority time zone.\r\n\r\nSee also [discussion](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9620#discussion-diff-3307962)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We have several select boxes with relatively long lists and want a small set of options to be placed at the top as they are used most often. And/or where we want to emphasise a certain option by always placing it at the top. Think of lists showing time zones, countries, languages, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently `time_zone_select` does something similar. This patch generalizes that case.\r\n\r\nIt accepts a `priority` option for `form.select`, `options_for_select` and `options_from_collection_for_select`. When specified the given values will be placed at the top of select options, followed by all the options separated by a line.\r\n\r\nFor example, the country_select plugin/gem then becomes a simple one-liner:\r\n```\r\n  f.select :country, COUNTRIES, :priority => [\"United States\", \"Canada\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `time_zone_options_for_select` delegates to `options_from_collection_for_select`. The time zone method would not show the priority zones below the fold. This patch will show the priorities at top, but also in their usual place below the fold. Especially in long lists users get confused when they are for example looking for the country \"United States\" at the bottom of the list, but then can't find it because it's shown as a priority country at the top. If a priority option is selected the option below the fold is not selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The previous fix has been to detect array\r\nparameters with `nil` values and to clobber the entire array into `nil`.\r\n\r\nInstead, compacting the array solves the security issue and causes less\r\nsurprise in the case where array parameters are expected, as is often\r\nthe case when accepting nested attributes for collections.",
