    "body": "We discovered this issue in one of our production apps, because we tried to use `touch` as a custom mime type, which led to the `touch` method of `Object` being executed sometimes, causing vexing errors.\n\nThis is the case for any mime type with the same name as a method on Object, even private ones.\n\nThis is caused by the following execution path:\n\n1. `respond_to :touch` is called in a controller. This adds `:touch` to the list of mimes.\n2. `retrieve_collector_from_mimes` calls `Collector.new(mimes)`\n3. `initialize` calls `mimes.each { |mime| send(mime) }`\n4. `send(:touch)`, instead of triggering `method_missing` on the `AbstractController::Collector`, actually calls `Object.touch`. This can lead to any sort of behavior.\n\nA proposed fix for this issue is attached. It is based on generating the required methods on `Collector` after each mime type is registered, instead of relying on `method_missing`. That way, `send` always hits them instead of going up to `Object`.\n\nCheck out the commit messages for more info.\n",

I also think that rails should encourage developers to version their apps.\n\nThis patch adds `version.rb` template to rails app generator. Initially file is commented out, so It does not specify any version number unless developer manually enables it.\n\n**edit**\n\nAs @josevalim mentioned, this can also be done using `config/applicatoin.rb` file.",
