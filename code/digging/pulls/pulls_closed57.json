Any datatype can be used to create an array column, with full migration and schema dumper support.\n\nTo declare an array column, use the following syntax:\n\n```ruby\ncreate_table :table_with_arrays do |t|\n  t.integer :int_array, :array => true\n  # integer[]\n  t.integer :int_array, :array => true, :length => 2\n  # smallint[]\n  t.string :string_array, :array => true, :length => 30\n  # char varying(30)[]\nend \n```\n\nThis respects any other migraion detail (limits, defaults, etc). ActiveRecord will serialize and deserialize the array columns on their way to and from the database.\n\nOne thing to note: PostgreSQL does not enforce any limits on the number of elements, and any array can be multi-dimensional. Any array that is multi-dimensional must be rectangular (each sub array must have the same number of elements as its siblings).\n\nI can squash this commit after review",

Once the 9.2 version will be release soon I think that would be nice if AR supports it too. \n\nBefore started this, I searched for someone that could be working on this already, and tweeted @tenderlove asking if he remembers about someone doing this job, since seems that nobody is working on this I'm sending this pull request and I'd like to know your opinions about this feature and about my implementation. I marked two \"FIXMEs\" that could be a DRY candidate, IMO. Maybe should AR:Store be changed too?\n\nThanks.",

    "body": "Note: the commits here are split to facilitate discussion. Happy to squash before merging.\n\nThe attached commits fix two bugs in `ActiveRecord::Store` and add a new feature. \n\n* the first commit moves the call to `will_change!` above the actual change to the attribute - otherwise, the attribute is marked as changed but attempts to access the previous value (using `_was` or `_change`) will return the *new* value instead\n\n* the second commit ensures that additional calls to `store_accessor` don't overwrite previously-set values in `stored_attributes`. This functionality is described in the documentation (regarding subclasses) but subsequent calls to `store_accessor` overwrote the list each time.\n\n* the final commit adds a new variant of `store_accessor` that provides type conversion for booleans to simplify (for instance) setting stored attributes with checkboxes. An example:\n\n```ruby\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  store :flags\n  store_boolean_attribute :flags, :likes_ruby, :likes_python, :likes_clojure\nend\n\nUser.first.likes_ruby? # => returns true or false\n\n@user.update_attributes(:likes_ruby => '0') # => stores false in flags['likes_ruby']\n```\n\nThere is some fairly gross duplication between `store_accessor` and `store_boolean_accessor`; any suggestions for a refactor are welcome - as is a better name than `store_boolean_accessor`.\n\nOne other open question: would it be better to add more \"typed\" variants to handle parsing input (for datetimes, etc)? My application only needed booleans, but there's certainly an argument to be made for extending the same type-casting behavior to `store_accessor` attributes as plain attributes.",

(For background discussion please refer to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/ge1HCeBqz_s)\n\n- added tests to confirm establish_connection uses DATABASE_URL and\n  Rails.env correctly even when no arguments are passed in.\n- updated rake db tasks to support DATABASE_URL, and added tests to\n  confirm correct behavior for these rake tasks.  (Removed\n  establish_connection call from some tasks since in those cases\n  the :environment task already made sure the function would be called)\n- updated Resolver so that when it resolves the database url, it\n  removes hash values with empty strings from the config spec (e.g.\n  to support connection to postgresql when no username is specified).\n\nThis fix can also address issues #6736 and #6833 (as slightly different implementation solution).",

    "body": "The attached code adds a `wrap_with` method to Relation that wraps objects retrieved from the relation in the specified class. A trivial example:\n\n```ruby\nclass UserWrapper < DelegateClass(User)\n  def magic_thing\n    puts 'wat'\n  end\nend\n\nUser.where(:name => 'Bob').wrap_with(UserWrapper).first.magic_thing # => prints 'wat'\n```\n\nA short test is included - suggestions for additional testing (or more meaningful testing) are welcome.\n\nThere are also a number of additional features that could be included here, if they make sense:\n\n* wrapping with additional classes may be useful; currently, chaining another `wrap_with` call overwrites the value set in the first one. This would be a simple change, given the existing plumbing for dealing with multi-valued data on Relation.\n\n* passing additional arguments to the method could be useful; for instance, `some_relation.wrap_with(SomeClass, :foo, :bar, :baz)` would pass the additional arguments on to the constructor, so each record in `some_relation` would be wrapped via `SomeClass.new(record, :foo, :bar, :baz)`. Again, a fairly trivial modification.\n\n* for extreme cases, passing a block may make more sense. For instance:\n```ruby\nsome_relation.wrap_with(SomeClass) { |some_class| some_class.do_something }\n# which wraps as:\nSomeClass.new(record).tap { |some_class| some_class.do_something }\n```\n\n* of course, there's also an argument that a zero-arg block version might make sense:\n```ruby\nsome_relation.wrap_with { |record| SomeClass.new(record) }\n```\nHere, `wrap_with` is just calling the block with the record directly.\n\n* the current code doesn't do anything when building / creating new records; it was extracted from a live app that used `wrap_with` solely for read-only views. I'm not certain what the desirable behavior is here.",

    "body": "When a block is passed into `HashWithIndifferentAccess#update` or `#merge`, it will be invoked for each duplicated key with the key in question, the value for the key in the receiver, and the value in the hash being merged. The return value of the block will be used to resolve the conflict:\n\n    hash_1 = ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new\n    hash_1[:key] = 10\n\n    hash_2 = ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new\n    hash_2['key'] = 20\n\n    hash_1.merge(hash_2) { |key, old, new| old + new } # => {\"key\"=>30}\n\nThis is consistent with long-standing behaviour of the Standard Library's `Hash` class. Indeed, without this change, it would not be immediately obvious to someone passing a block into `HashWithIndifferentAccess#merge` that its behaviour doesn't reflect `Hash#merge`, as the block will be silently ignored.",
