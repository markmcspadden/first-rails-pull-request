    "body": "This pull request decouples Parameters from the actual logging, instead using a LogSubscriber for that. Since ActiveSupport::Notifications is used, it is trivial to add other subscribers if needed. I'd like to add a Statsd subscriber in one of my own apps in order to monitor the frequency of unpermitted param injection attempts, but many other uses seem possible.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to include the controller and action in the event payload, but that would require a larger change. If you guys deem it desirable I would be happy to do it.",

Actually, I found this bug when upgrading from 3.2.12 to 3.2.13.rc2, so I'd like to backport this to 3-2-13.\r\n\r\nFormtastic is always providing an explicit name, and it already ends with \"[]\" for one-to-many associations (see [here](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic/blob/master/lib/formtastic/inputs/select_input.rb#L201)).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nselect(:category, [], {}, {:multiple => true, :name => \"post[category][]\"})\r\n# => <select name=\"post[category][][]\" ...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nselect(:category, [], {}, {:multiple => true, :name => \"post[category][]\"})\r\n# => <select name=\"post[category][]\" ...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbable culprits are 175ba04c on master and 2a6f208e on 3-2-13.\r\n\r\n/cc @tenderlove would you like me to open a separate PR with a backport?",

    "body": "Any exceptions that occur in a controller using ActionController::Live would cause the server to either hang with an open socket indefinitely, or immediately crash (depending on whether the server was launched with rails s or directly).\r\n\r\nEasiest way to duplicate the issue is to include ActionController::Live, and visit a route that has no associated view, or to call an undefined method. Issue was reproduced with Ruby 1.9.3 as well as 2.0.\r\n\r\nAdded a catch block in Live to make exception handling work similarly to streaming templates. A redirect to 500.html is issued using a script tag, the stream is closed, and the exception is logged to the terminal.",
