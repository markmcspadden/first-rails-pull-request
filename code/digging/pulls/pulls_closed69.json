The first part of this will be to add PBKDF2 for key derivation, then we can switch the session store and cookies.signed to use derived keys instead of using the bare secret.\n\nSimilarly future functionality like encrypted cookies / sessions can utilize derived keys.\n\nSo before merging I want to get some feedback from @meder and @thaidn on the particulars of our implementation.  In particular, what are suitable default values for `iterations` and `key_size`.\n\nThis is a pre-requisite for #3955 #5034 and possibly others.\n\nNote to other committers: Please leave this one for me to merge",

    "body": "By marshalling and unmarshalling jobs when adding them to the test queue, we can ensure that jobs created during test runs are valid candidates for marshalling, and, thus, that they can be used with queueing backends other than the default simple in-process implementation.\n\nAs Rails::Queueing::Queue (and TestQueue) are not marshallable, this ensures that a queued job does not contain a reference to the queue itself.\n\nThis establishes marshallability and a constrained object graph as a standard expectation for jobs, which is, I think, a reasonable expectation. Where an application explicitly does not care about this, authors are free to configure a different test queue implementation in the application's test environment.\n",

    "body": "The issue I encountered was that Rails mountable engines didn't work\ncorrectly with SASS and the Asset Pipeline.\n\nIn my testcase, I have an engine that specifies some asset gem in its `foo.gemspec`. In the `lib/foo/engine.rb` it requires the gem. Then `application.css.scss` did:\n\n    @import 'file_from_gem';\n\nThat file would not be able to be found when trying out the engine\nusing the dummy application (`cd test/dummy && rails server`).\n\nIt *would* all work fine when the engine is tried out using a \"full\" Rails application as generated with `rails new fullapp`. Going over the diff between the generated test dummy and the full app, I found that changing the `Bundler.require` statement in `config/application.rb` fixed the issue, even though I'm not completely sure why.\n\nTL;DR: The change in this commit fixes that @import statements that load css found in gems work correctly in the generated `test/dummy` application for Rails engines.\n",

    "body": "## EDIT: posted more information.\n\nI might have posted too much code and did too little explaining the reasoning. The problem is that there are heaps of non thread safe usage of Hashes in Rails and the surrounding gems. This needs to be fixed. Instead of littering the whole code base with the `synchronize {}` blocks, it is better done by creating a fully thread-safe hash-like data structure.\n\nThis is where `ThreadSafe::Cache` comes in. It is:\n * a thread-safe hash-like data structure\n * reads are lock-free\n * writes might be using locks, but this is fixable in the future\n * storing an item in `Cache` constitutes safe publication\n * reads have volatile semantics (allows for properly done double-checked locking idiom)\n * writes have volatile semantics\n\nWhy is it better than explicit synchronisation?\n\nA thread-safe hash is a very useful abstraction, it simplifies the code and allows to avoid worrying about thread-safety most of the time. Explicit locking is not so easily done and is prone to missing some code paths. As the amount of explicit locks increases, so does the probability of deadlocks. Locks are slightly slower than lock-free volatile reads and scale horribly as the concurrency level increases.\n\n----\n\n## Original pull request text:\n\n----\n\nFinally bit the bullet and wrote a thread safe hash-like `Cache` implementation. It is going to be available through [thread_safe](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe) gem.\n\nI used a custom middleware to hunt down concurrent collection usage: [ThreadSafetyTester](https://github.com/thedarkone/rack-contrib/blob/thread-safety-tester/lib/rack/contrib/thread_safety_tester.rb).\n\n```ruby\nthread_safety_test_options = {\n  :skip_paths => [/\\A\\/assets\\//],\n  :whitelist => {\n    Hash => [\n      'active_support/descendants_tracker.rb', # ok, when eager loaded in production mode\n      'active_support/dependencies.rb', # dev. mode related\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite3_adapter.rb',\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/query_cache.rb', # query cache is connection confined\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb', # query cache usage\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/schema_cache.rb', # SchemaCache is connection confined\n      'webrick/utils.rb',\n      'webrick/httpresponse.rb'\n    ],\n    Set => 'active_support/dependencies.rb', # dev. mode related\n    Array => [\n      'active_support/dependencies.rb', # dev. mode related\n      'active_support/log_subscriber.rb', # Thread local array\n      'active_support/tagged_logging.rb', # Thread local array\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb', # Synchronized array queue\n      'active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/database_statements.rb' # connection confined\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nconfig.middleware.insert_before 'ActionDispatch::Static', 'Rack::ThreadSafetyTester', thread_safety_test_options\n```\n\nI'm not looking to get this merged right away. A feedback on the `ThreadSafe::Cache` API is also welcomed.",
