    "body": "These commits fix a number of subtle mocha-related bugs that have been present for a while :-\r\n\r\n* Mocha was raising a `MiniTest::Assertion` instead of a\r\n  `Mocha::ExpectationError` as intended. The latter is not recognized by\r\n  MiniTest as an assertion failure and so it is recorded as a test\r\n  *error*, not a test *failure* as it ought to. This leads to\r\n  potentially confusing output in the test results.\r\n\r\n* Mocha verification should happen as part of the test. The verification\r\n  of expectations is equivalent to a set of assertions. These assertions\r\n  should happen as *part of* the test so that they have a chance to\r\n  cause the test to fail, and not just as part of the teardown. Also if\r\n  an assertion fails during the test, then there is no need to verify\r\n  expectations, because only the first assertion failure is normally\r\n  reported and all subsequent bets are off.\r\n\r\n* Expectation verification should be counted as an assertion. Mocha\r\n  cannot record each expectation verification as an assertion, because\r\n  we weren't passing in an assertion counter to `#mocha_verify`.\r\n\r\nThe code has unfortunately become relatively complicated to support different versions of mocha. If it is acceptable to only support the latest version of mocha (v0.13.0) onwards, I'd suggest it would be preferable to accept [this other pull request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8180) which simplifies the code considerably.\r\n\r\nI'd be more than happy to provide back-ported fixes to 3-x-stable branches if these would be useful.",

    "body": "As well as simplifying the code considerably and reducing coupling to mocha, these changes also fix a few subtle mocha-related bugs present in the current implementation :-\r\n\r\n* Mocha was raising a `MiniTest::Assertion` instead of a\r\n  `Mocha::ExpectationError` as intended. The latter is not recognized by\r\n  MiniTest as an assertion failure and so it is recorded as a test\r\n  *error*, not a test *failure* as it ought to. This leads to\r\n  potentially confusing output in the test results.\r\n\r\n* Mocha verification should happen as part of the test. The verification\r\n  of expectations is equivalent to a set of assertions. These assertions\r\n  should happen as *part of* the test so that they have a chance to\r\n  cause the test to fail, and not just as part of the teardown. Also if\r\n  an assertion fails during the test, then there is no need to verify\r\n  expectations, because only the first assertion failure is normally\r\n  reported and all subsequent bets are off.\r\n\r\n* Expectation verification should be counted as an assertion. Mocha\r\n  cannot record each expectation verification as an assertion, because\r\n  we weren't passing in an assertion counter to `#mocha_verify`.\r\n\r\nThese changes only work with mocha v0.13.0 or later. In case you would prefer to support older versions of mocha, I will submit an alternative pull request, however the code in that pull request will be necessarily more complicated/messy.\r\n\r\nI'd be more than happy to provide back-ported fixes to 3-x-stable branches if these would be useful.",

    "body": "I changed `#pluck` to spawn a new relation and then modify the `select_values` directly to ignore previously present `select` clauses. This patch simply ignores present `select` clauses.\r\n\r\nThere was also trailing whitespace in the `CHANGELOG.md` (created a separate commit to remove it, so that it's easier to backport)\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for #7551\r\n\r\nThe `ActiveRecord::Calculations` module has a couple of methods, which modify the `select_values` of a relation directly. I thought about a small refactoring to expose a method on `ActiveRecord::QueryMethods` to assign fields directly to `select_values` instead of concatenate them as `select` does. This could be named something like `#select_only` or `#force_select` (could also be implemented with a parameter to `select` like `:force => true` or `:override => true`.\r\nI wanted to submit this PR first though to ask wether this is necessary or not.",
