In this relation all the context that\r\n`Post` was joined with `Author` is lost and hence the error that `author` was not found on `Comment`.\r\n\r\nThs solution is to build JoinAssociation when two relations with join information are being merged. And later\r\nwhile building the arel use the  previously built `JoinAssociation` record in `JoinDependency#graft` to\r\nbuild the right from clause.\r\n\r\nThanks to Jared Armstrong (https://github.com/armstrjare) for most of the work. I ported it to make it\r\ncompatible with new code base.\r\n\r\n/cc @jonleighton",

While reviewing the code time and again\r\nI had the mental picture of active_record being an instance of\r\na klass. However here the actual klass is being stored in\r\n@active_record.\r\n\r\nSecondly at two different places while referring to @active_record\r\nthe comment refers to it as base klass. All this points to\r\nactive_record being not the best variable name.\r\n\r\nSo I thought it is better to replace active_record with base_klass.\r\n\r\nThis change is confined to JoinDependency, JoinBase, JoinPart and\r\nJoinAssociation - all joining related work.",
