    "body": "Sprockets currently generates gzipped javascript and css files next to their uncompressed counterparts. However, to take advantage of this you need to use an nginx extension or something similar.\r\n\r\nThis patch will allow ActionDispatch::Static to serve up these gzipped files when appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor example, this request:\r\n\r\n    curl -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" http://localhost:3000/assets/application.js\r\n\r\nWill look for application.js.gz on disk and respond with:\r\n\r\n     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n     Content-Type: application/javascript\r\n     Content-Encoding: gzip\r\n     Content-Length: 1234\r\n     More-Headers...\r\n\r\n     <compressed data>\r\n\r\nThis is particularly helpful for environments like Heroku, that depend on ActionDispatch::Static to serve static assets. Currently, the only way to serve gzipped assets in this environment is to install Rack::Deflate ahead of ActionDispatch::Static. This is undesirable, because Rack::Deflate compresses everything, including compressed assets like images and swfs.",

Currently the charset is only skipped when we are sending a file using `send_file` or `send_data`. I see the following options:\r\n\r\n1. skip the charset for all responses generated with `head`\r\n1. inspect the content-type and only append the charset if it's necessary. (This would need some kind of white/blacklist, which could be brittle)\r\n",

    "body": "We have a class called `RoutesInspector`. It's purpose is to aggregate the routes so that they can be displayed in the console (`rake routes`). Recently a routes listing was added to the exception page. This listing used parts of `RoutesInspector` but since the class was intermingled with formatting logic for the console, only parts could be reused. This led to #8649.\r\n\r\nTo solve this I did:\r\n\r\n1. split the formatting logic and `RoutesInspector`.\r\n1. when formatting a filter can be applied. We did not have test coverage for the filter argument, so I added a small test case.\r\n1. The `RoutesInspector` now holds the routes it operates on as an instance variable. This allows to instantiate the inspector but apply the formatting later (when we don't have access to the routes anymore).\r\n1. use the same code path to aggregate routes for the console and the web (only the formatter is different).\r\n1. I noticed that there was no test, that rendered the routes table on the exception page. This could lead to embarrassing errors. I added such a test to make sure we don't have any obvious errors. \r\n\r\nThis fixes #8649",

With this commit, you can now do that.\r\n\r\nI've typed these commands enough times over the years and ended up with empty migrations that I finally decided to add them to Rails and see if anyone else considered it useful.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    rails g migration create_posts title:string\r\nor\r\n    \r\n    rails g migration CreatePosts title:string\r\n\r\nThis commit also moves the template the model generator uses for the migration to the migration templates folder, as it seems a more sensible place for it now that it is shared code.",

    "body": "This is a follow up to: #8636\r\n\r\nWhen a table or a column is renamed related indexes kept their name. This will lead to confusing names. This patch renames related indexes when a column or a table is renamed. Only indexes with names generated by rails will be renamed. Indexes with custom names will not be renamed.\r\n\r\nI performed the following operations:\r\n\r\n1.  renamed argument `name` to `table_name` in `#rename_table` (PostgreSQL and SQLite). I changed the name to make it consistent across the adapters and the API\r\n1. `rename_table_indexes` and `rename_column_indexes` are available to rename related indexes. These methods are called from the individual adapters. I modified SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nI noticed that the method to generated the name of an index is order dependent. This means that `index_name` will return a different name when the columns are passed in different order:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nindex_name('articles', :column => ['a', 'b']) != index_name('articles', :column => ['b', 'a'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was problematic when implementing the rename for multi-column indexes. It works at the moment but the order dependent code could lead to indexes not being renamed. I would like to sort the columns before generating the name but this would have a bad impact on backwards compatibility because rails would generate different index names. Any ideas?",
