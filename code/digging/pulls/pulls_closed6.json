Leaving `secret_token` set causes no harm, and its presence allows for a smooth transition from Rails 3.x to 4.x. \r\n\r\nI propose that we leave `LegacyKeyGenerator` around beyond version 4.0.x. \r\n\r\nI suspect that latecomers will attempt to upgrade from 3.x to whatever the most recent 4.x version happens to be. If we remove `LegacyKeyGenerator`, then people attempting to upgrade from 3.x to >= 4.1 won't be able to preserve their existing signed cookies and cookie-based sessions. ",

I'm making a PR instead of using doc rails because I'm not sure if this is the best place to put this comment, or whether it is better put in some other part of the docs (or maybe if it isn't relevant at all and should be left out).",
