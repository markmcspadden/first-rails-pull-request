    "body": "\nIf the host in default_url_options is accidentally set with a protocol such as `:host => \"http://example.com\"` then the generated url will have the protocol twice `http://http://example.com` which is not what the user intended. Likely they wanted to define a host `:host => \"example.com\"` and a `:protocol => \"http://\"` but did not know the convention.\n\nThis is may not the most common problem, but when it happens it can go undetected for a while. I accidentally added `http://` out of habit recently only to find all the links in my emails were broken after deploying a demo site to production. Rather than allow this accident go undetected, we can fix the problem in line by properly setting the protocol and host.\n\n\nI was able to find this related question on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5878329/rails-3-devise-how-do-i-make-the-email-confirmation-links-use-secure-https-n\n where the answer was highly upvoted. \n\nATP Action Mailer, Actionpack, and Railties",

    "body": "I'm submitting this pull request because of some confusion I had using this method (and its alias). When I originally tried the method, I attempted to do something like `time_ago_in_words 15.minutes` which now I realize was an error on my part because this method expects its argument to be a `Time`.\n\nMy initial reaction was that this is a pretty obvious bug in rails since it didn't jump out to me in the docs that the argument must be a `Time` and writing it as `time_ago_in_words 15.minutes.ago` felt a little clumsy with the \"ago\" redundancy.\n\nIt was even a little more confusing going from using the `distance_of_time_in_words` method with simple `15.minutes` (because the default `from_time` is simply `0`) to the alias method `distance_of_time_in_words_to_now` and having to supply a `Time`.\n\nAnyway, at the very least, it seems some minor improvements to the docs (perhaps what I've attached?) may help the situation, and at the most perhaps some retinkering of this API (a job I currently feel unqualified of).\n\nThanks for the awesome work!",

    "body": "There is a common use case where mail settings are dynamic based on settings saved in database. For example, we could let companies provide us with their SMTP credentials which can be used to send email on their behalf. My particular use case dealt with creating a delivery method which sends SMSes based on company's credentials to company's users.\n\nThis PR allows the user to easily set delivery method settings from within the mail instance\n\n````ruby\nclass MySmsMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n  def send_sms(company,telephone_number,message)\n    mail :to => telephone_number, \n         :body => message, \n         :delivery_method => :sms_sender, \n         :delivery_method_options => company.sms_credentials\n  end\nend\n````\n\nor\n\n````ruby\nclass UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n  def campaign_blast(company,telephone_number,message)\n    mail :to => telephone_number, \n         :body => message, \n         :delivery_method_options => {:username => company.smtp_user, \n                                      :password => company.smtp_password}\n  end\nend\n````\n\n\n\nThe alternative to doing this would be rather ugly\n\n````ruby\nm = MySmsMailer.send_sms(company,number,message)\nm.delivery_method.some_method_that_sets_options_on_sms_sender_instance(company.sms_credentials)\nm.deliver\n````\n\nWe could try to set delivery options by resetting them on classes but I dont imagine it would be threadsafe to do that!\n\n/cc @josevalim @mikel \n",

Maybe I missed it, since the PredicateBuilder\ndoes create equality nodes in stock AR with a hash, but\nthe only one I noticed was using order and strings to test.",

I've fixed both methods to take `inversed_of` option into account. So now this example will work as intented, I've provided test to illustrate it.",

    "body": "When you add one callack in two separate `set_callback` calls - it is only called once.\n\nWhen you do it in one `set_callback` call - it is called twice.\n\nThis violates the principle of least astonishment for me. Duplicating callback is usually an error. There is a correct and obvious way to do anything without this \"feature\".\n\nIf you want to do:\n\n```ruby\nbefore_save :clear_balance, :calculate_tax, :clear_balance\n```\n\nor whatever, you should better do:\n\n```ruby\nbefore_save :carefully_calculate_tax\n\ndef carefully_calculate_tax\n  clear_balance\n  calculate_tax\n  clear_balance\nend\n```\n\nAnd this even opens gates for some advanced refactorings, unlike the first approach.\n\nMy assumptions are:\n\n- Principle of least astonishment is violated, when callbacks are either prevented from duplication, or not.\n- Duplicating callbacks is usually an error. When it is intentional -  it's a smell of a bad design and can be approached without abusing this \"feature\".\n\nMy suggestion is: do not allow duplicating callbacks in one callback call, like it is not allowed in separate callbacks call.\n\nP.S. It's currently one test on railties failing in __master__ and so in this branch __also__. It's not me!\n\n```\n 1) Failure:\ntest_0006_reload constants on development(LoadingTest) [test/application/loading_test.rb:135]:\nExpected: \"2\"\n  Actual: \"1\"\n```",
