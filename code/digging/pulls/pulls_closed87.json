Since this was part of a [commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f1c13b0dd7b22b5f6289ca1a09f1d7a8c7c8584b) that was then [reverted](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/75015d1b5cae80826ef41add3c84d1dd51fee259) I wasn't sure which one was preferred. I went with `persisted?`.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, forced session_id to be passed as a string to the sql queries since postgresql was complaining about type mismatch (string column vs integer value on where clause).\r\n\r\nCheers",

So a link to the show action like this:\r\n\r\n    <%= link_to 'user', user_path %>\r\n\r\nThis will produce an error like this:\r\n\r\n    No route matches {:action=>\"show\", :controller=>\"users\"}\r\n\r\nSince we know that the :id is missing, and this route likely needs it we can add extra debugging information to the error message.\r\n\r\n    No route matches {:action=>\"show\", :controller=>\"users\"}, :id key is missing\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will help new and seasoned developers look closer at their :id parameter in their view helpers. While not all errors will be a result of a missing :id key, this error message implies the most likely cause without declaring it the culprit.\r\n\r\nBefore PR: http://cl.ly/121J0o3x2F2m2s3j0F3q\r\nAfter PR: http://cl.ly/2t0A082x2L3k3e2M2Q0U\r\nAfter PR (other params): http://cl.ly/3N1w0N161b213n0x2c0U\r\n",

    "body": "As noted in #5849, Rails does not currently support module namespaces containing underscores. This is largely due to how ActiveSupport::Inflector.camelize and ActiveSupport::Inflector.underscore currently work.\n\nThis pull request essentially introduces a new convention whereby module namespaces containing underscores are translated to paths with *two* underscores for each underscore, and vice versa. For example:\n\n```\n\"API::V0_1_0\" --> \"api/v0__1__0\"\n```\n\n```\n\"api/v0__1__0\" --> \"API::V0_1_0\"\n```\nI'm not married to this convention by any stretch, I'm just throwing it out there as a straw man.\n\nIn addition to this fix for the 3-2-stable branch, I've also made this change for the 3-0-stable, 3-1-stable, and master branches as well. You can find them in the following branches in my repo (if you want a separate pull request for each just let me know):\n\nunderscores-in-namespaces-3-0-stable\nunderscores-in-namespaces-3-1-stable\nunderscores-in-namespaces-3-2-stable\nunderscores-in-namespaces-master\n\nI can also fix this for the 2.x series branches as well if you want, just let me know.\n\nThanks,\nBrian",
