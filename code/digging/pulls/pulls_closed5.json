The documentation attempts to explain what the ``FormBuilder`` class does. \r\n\r\nI've also changed the ``field_helpers`` attribute to an explicit list of methods. The reason I did this was because the old way of defining the ``field_helpers`` called ``FormHelper.instance_methods`` and subtracted away some methods. It is hard to figure out what methods these are without running the code, so I think that this change so make things more readable and understandable. Thoughts?",

The section still exists but merely to link to the testing guide.\r\n* linked the mentioned RFC\r\n* replaced usages of `user` with `@user` if `@user` is available\r\n* linked to the Action Mailer section in the configuring guide\r\n\r\nI also removed the WIP flag in `documents.yml`",

No check was made for such a typecasted value in the default extraction code.\r\n\r\nThe main consequence of the bug (and how I discovered it) is through schema dumping. A test case is included that covers this issue. Let me know if a test closer to the root cause is required.",

    "body": "This allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for\r\n`ActionController`:\r\n\r\n    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter\r\n\r\nPreviously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks\r\nin `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object\r\nfilter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on\r\n`@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`.\r\nSo, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to\r\nremove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter\r\nobject and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.",
