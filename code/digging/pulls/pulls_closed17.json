As pointed out by @nashby the load order was messed up so that `app.sandbox` was nil when the AR console initializer ran. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\nEven after the fix the data created will not rollback. There is still something fishy going on with the sandboxing of the console. That's why I did not add a CHANGELOG entry but I think we should merge this to help other people, who are looking at the sandboxing problem.",

Ideas? \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",

The ```find()``` method on an association will now first check to see if any records exist in the association with the given ids before visiting the database. This prevents an unneeded database call if the records already exist in memory.\r\n\r\nThe new function scans the target of the association for the ids sent as inputs to ```find()```. The ids of the records that are found are removed from the ids which will be sent to the database.",

    "body": "TL;DR; Overridden column defaults do not get marked as changed for new records, causing the locking column default to not get saved\r\n\r\n__Premise__: In `ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic#column_defaults` we set the default value for the locking column to `0` if it's not already set by the database.\r\n\r\n__Problem__: Due to the introduction of partial inserts @ 144e8691cbfb8bba77f18cfe68d5e7fd48887f5e, this overridden default will get ignored and never persisted to the database.  This results in the locking column having a `nil` value for new records.  The reason this happens is because `ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Dirty#keys_for_partial_write` will skip writing attributes that are not marked as changed.  When a new record's default attributes are set, the list of changed attributes is always assumed to be empty -- we don't actually check to verify that.\r\n\r\n__Solution__: When a new record's default attributes are set, *also* initialize the list of changed attributes by comparing current values against what's stored as the column defaults.  This initialization step intentionally does not use the `#column_defaults` helper since that's what's used by `ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic` to set the overridden default in the first place.\r\n\r\n__Verification__: Two existing locking tests have been modified to verify that they're locking column defaults are persisted to the database.  These tests were failing prior to this change.\r\n\r\nThis change will also fix other libraries that have been relying on this behavior.",
