    "body": "This is an old bug where rake db:schema:dump imported all columns with the type enum as :limit => 0, making schema.rb don't work on with anything that relies on it(db:schema:load).\n\nThis issue were raised here: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/997-dbschemadump-saves-enum-columns-as-varchar0-on-mysql\n\nAnd there's other posts on the web about it.\n\nI solved it by setting the limit as the biggest enum value string size. I wonder if shouldn't we just set it as like 255 to only make it work.\n\nI think it's also time that rails supports enum columns. There's plugins that do that, but I would gadly make it work.\n\nFeel free to comment about the code or the regexp, I will also gadly change it.",

The cache is implemented using a Hash, which isn't threadsafe in all VMs (notably JRuby).\n\nThis includes three commits, the first puts a global lock around the whole process. The second improves this to add a more granular lock. Finally, some readability improvements for the caching logic.",

    "body": "My first patch for rails!\n\nWhen saving a frozen? record, active record would raise an exception to complain about the frozen attributes, rollback the transaction. However, it also has the side effect of unfreezing the record after the rollback. This behaviour is undesirable and incorrect (saving a frozen? record twice in a roll would fail for the first time and succeed in the second time). This patch fixes the bug by explicitly restoring the frozen? state after a rollback.",

    "body": "When saving a `frozen?` record, active record would raise an exception to complain about the frozen attributes, rollback the transaction. However, it also has the side effect of unfreezing the record after the rollback. This behaviour is undesirable and incorrect (saving a `frozen?` record twice in a roll would fail for the first time and succeed in the second time). This patch fixes the bug by explicitly restoring the `frozen?` state after a rollback.\n\nThis is my first patch for rails, so I apologize in advance if this should go in master instead of 3-2-stable. I can reapply this to master if that's more appropriate.",

    "body": "Introduction: I'm using JRuby in a Java servlet container to run an application that uses ActiveRecord.  This is a fully multithreaded environment where a thread pool services http requests, possibly in parallel.  I've been having problems with timeouts when obtaining a database connection with only moderate concurrent requests.\n\n(Reducing the size of the thread pool to match that of the connection pool may be one option, but I am running multiple apps in the servlet container all sharing one thread pool...  So for now, the thread pool is 32 and the connection pool is 5).\n\nI'm putting this patch out there to solicit comments.  I think it needs more testing.  I may have a chance this week to test in a real application, but for now I only have my two benchmark scripts ar_test.rb (for JRuby) and ar_test_mri.rb. Notably, I have not tested the behavior when connections are removed explicitly or removed by the reaper.\n\nI also do not understand the distinction between PoolFullError and ConnectionTimeoutError.  I also introduced an @available array of connections ready to be checked out.  At the time this seemed like a reasonable idea, but I had to make some inelegant additions (essentially everywhere @connections is modified, @available must be also, e.g. #clear_reloadable_connections).\n\nI apologize for the length of this report.\n\ntl;dr **the fairness patch reduces outliers in time to acquire a connection but needs review and testing**\n\nThe test suite passes, tested on Linux/Ruby-1.9.2-p290.\n\n    activerecord$ bundle exec rake test_sqlite3\n    Finished tests in 193.646555s, 17.1859 tests/s, 52.2653 assertions/s.\n    3328 tests, 10121 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 12 skips\n\n----\n\nThis patch makes the connection pool \"fair\" in the first-come, first-served sense.  It also avoids using the Timeout class (which spawns a dedicated thread for each connection checkout attempt that needs to to wait with a timeout).\n\nI've added two tests that fail before applying this patch.  The first ensures the connection pool is fair by queuing up several waiting threads and ensuring they acquire connections in order as connections are made available.  The connections are trickled in one by one because we don't actually care when two connections become available that order is strictly preserved.\n\nThe second queues up two groups of waiting threads, then checks in enough connections for group 1 all at once.  The test ensures that only the group 1 threads acquired connections.\n\nA third test is the money test but was removed because it was unreliable.  It attempted to test latency in a Java-servlet-like environment by setting up a thread pool and having each thread check connections in and out.\n\nInstead, I used ar_test.rb to obtain histograms of the time per simulated request (checkout connection; sleep 0.01s; checkin connection).\n\nTests with ar_test.rb and JRuby 1.6.6\n=====================================\n\nActiveRecord 3.2.3, JRuby 1.6.6\n-------------------------------------\n\n    $ bundle exec jruby --1.9 ar_test.rb\n    10000 reqs in 24.666 = 405.4 req/s\n    min/max/mean 0.01/2.37/0.08\n    histogram\n    [0.00,0.03) ooooooooooooooo\n    [0.03,0.05) o\n    [0.05,0.08) oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n    [0.08,0.10) ooooo\n    [0.10,0.13) o\n    [0.13,0.15) oooooo\n    [0.15,0.18) o\n    [0.18,0.20) oo\n    [0.20,0.22) o\n    [0.22,0.25) oo\n\nActiveRecord edge without fairness patch JRuby 1.6.6\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n    Gave up after long time.

    "body": "I would like to start a discussion about ensuring that every helper is requireable on its own. In my project at work, I have tests that sits outside of Rails. One of my classes uses a helper out of ActionView. I shouldn't have to require all of ActionView or ActionPack just to be able to use one method from one helper. I should be able to just require the file I need and keep going.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case for NumberHelper -- if you require it and then try to use one of its methods, you get:\n\n~~~\n~/code/github/forks/rails/actionpack on ruby 1.9.3-p125-falcon (master)\n$ ruby -I actionpack/lib -r action_view/helpers/number_helper -e 'h = Object.new.extend(ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper); h.number_to_currency(2)'\n/Users/elliot/code/github/forks/rails/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/number_helper.rb:131:in `number_to_currency': undefined method `symbolize_keys' for {}:Hash (NoMethodError)\n\tfrom -e:1:in `<main>'\n~~~\n\nI've quickly patched NumberHelper so that this is possible. However, I imagine that some of the other helpers are this way, too, and if so I'd be happy to fix them and add tests to confirm that this works.\n\nI appreciate how Yehuda Katz tried to keep this in mind when working on Rails 3, but it seems that this mindset has been abandoned since he left, which is a bit of a shame. What's the consensus on this issue?",

The cache is implemented\nusing a Hash, which isn't threadsafe in all VMs (notably JRuby).\n\nThis includes two commits, the first puts a global lock around the whole process.\nThe second improves this to add a more granular lock.",
