More specifically <code>/^'(.*)'$/</code> regular expression would not match <code>\"'\\n'\"</code> since dot (.) in this expression is intended to match any character <b>except for newline</b> character and hence column default was not stripped correctly out of enclosing quotes returned by database when querying for table structure.",

So \n\n```ruby\n\nclass ProductController < ApplicationController\n\n  def create\n    if @product.save\n      redirect_to root_path, :notice => t('.saved')\n    else\n      flash[:error] = t('.failed')\n    end\n  end\n\nend\n\n# will equal to \n\nclass ProductController < ApplicationController\n\n  def create\n    if @product.save\n      redirect_to root_path, :notice => t('product.create.saved')\n    else\n      flash[:error] = t('product.create.failed')\n    end\n  end\n\nend",

    "body": "This is a patch meant for 4.0 that will move most inflections that are\ncurrently defined in `activesupport/lib/active_support/inflections.rb`\nto the inflection initializer template defined in Railties.\n\nInflections are currently \"frozen\" in Rails. Commits that add/remove/alter\ninflections are largely ignored whether or not they make sense when\nconsidering English grammar. The freezing was a decision made to avoid\nbreaking existing apps that depend on these defined inflections. By moving the\ninflections to an initializer, we can unfreeze this area of Rails and change\ninflections without fear of breaking existing applications.\n\nAdditionally, this will garner more understanding as to how Rails\npluralization/singularization works. For oddities that occur in the\ninflections Rails has defined, it's often simply a \"WTF?\" moment (e.g.\nwhy \"hard drives\" would singularize as \"hard drife\", or why \"safe\" would\npluralize to \"saves\") and people have to source dive in order to figure\nout why their singularization/pluralization is not working as expected. Laying\nthem all out in the initializer will reduce a lot of headache associated with\ninflection oddities.\n\nTwo things to note:\n\n1. I've left the two basic inflections within ActiveSupport. These are:\n  * Add an \"s\" to make a word plural (unless it already has one)\n  * Remove an s to make a word singular (unless it ends in two)\n\n  I'm not actually sure about whether that second one should be\n  included, or even if I should move both to the initializer as well.\n  I'd appreciate some input on that.\n\n2. I have another pull request open (pull request #6820) that would need\n   to be modified if this is merged.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Celis <david@davidcelis.com>",
