This patch adds support for that.  Without this patch it's impossible to use the [full-text search query syntax](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en//fulltext-search.html), because in the test database it would continue to use the default engine for all, and not add the fulltext option to the index that is create (just a standard key would be created, which isn't what we needed).\n\n* When dumping the schema to schema.rb, include engine information, and add a flag for fulltext indexes.\n* When engine and fulltext index flags are in the migration, create the index as a fulltext one.\n\n__Sources:__\n\nIntegrated: [multiple engine support from this gist](https://gist.github.com/1374003)",

It aslo includes the same behaviour for ```create_join_table``` and ```change_table```.\n\nI still have to:\n\n* Describe it in the rdocs\n* Possibly use this in the schema.rb generation\n* Change the tests and internal usage of the ```do |t| ``` pattern\n* Deprecation ?\n* Update CHANGELOG\n\nBut first, I want to know if such feature will be accepted.",
