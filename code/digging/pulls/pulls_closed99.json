    "body": "## Issue:\r\n\r\nWhen loading an object that doesn't contains all the columns (using 'select' for example), IdentityMap stores this partial object. If this object is used later, but in this case we want all the attributes (or at least one that wasn't loaded at the beginning), then we will get a 'MissingAttributeError'. The following code will fail, for example\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::IdentityMap.use do\r\n  author = Author.select(:id).first\r\n  post = author.posts.first\r\n\r\n  name = post.author.name\r\nend\r\n```\r\nHowever, this code will load the author's name from the db:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nauthor = Author.select(:id).first\r\npost = author.posts.first\r\n\r\nname = post.author.name\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\n\r\nIf the object being loaded doesn't contain all values for all its columns, then we don't save it in the repository of IdentityMap.\r\n\r\nI also did some refactoring in base.rb\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the number of commits, I will try to make fewer commits in a pull request next time. I can apply the cherry picks to the other branches if you accept this pull request.",

If this object is used later, but in this case we want all the attributes (or at least one that wasn't loaded at the beginning), then we will get a 'MissingAttributeError'. The following code will fail, for example\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::IdentityMap.use do\r\n  author = Author.select(:id).first\r\n  post = author.posts.first\r\n\r\n  name = post.author.name\r\nend\r\n```\r\nHowever, this code will load the author's name from the db:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nauthor = Author.select(:id).first\r\npost = author.posts.first\r\n\r\nname = post.author.name\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\n\r\nIf the object being loaded doesn't contain all values for all its columns, then we don't save it in the repository of IdentityMap.\r\n\r\nI also did some refactoring in base.rb\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the number of commits, I will try to make fewer commits in a pull request next time. I can apply the cherry picks to the other branches if you accept this pull request.",
