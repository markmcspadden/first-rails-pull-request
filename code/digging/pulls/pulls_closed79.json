    "body": "\n\nAn AR ConnectionSpec `wait_timeout` is pre-patch used for three\ndifferent things:\n\n* mysql2 uses it for MySQL's own wait_timeout (how long MySQL\n  should allow an idle connection before closing it), and\n  defaults to 2592000 seconds.\n* ConnectionPool uses it for \"number of seconds to block and\n  wait for a connection before giving up and raising a timeout error\",\n  default 5 seconds.\n* ConnectionPool uses it for the Reaper, for deciding if a 'dead'\n  connection can be reaped. Default 5 seconds.\n\nPreviously, if you want to change these from defaults, you need\nto change them all together. This is problematic _especially_\nfor the mysql2/ConnectionPool conflict, you will generally _not_\nwant them to be the same, as evidenced by their wildly different\ndefaults. This has caused real problems for people #6441 #2894\n\nBut as long as we're changing this, forcing renaming the\nConnectionPool key to be more specific, it made sense\nto seperate the two ConnectionPool uses too -- these two\ntypes of ConnectionPool timeouts ought to be able to be\nchanged independently, you won't neccesarily want them\nto be the same, even though the defaults are (currently)\nthe same.",

I haven't checked to see if this is still an issue on master, but I'll add another PR if so.\n\nThanks guys!",
