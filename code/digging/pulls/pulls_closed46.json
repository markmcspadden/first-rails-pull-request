    "body": "My original issue was #7978. Our app's emails were showing up in Gmail as plain text only, and I couldn't figure out why. I checked the raw text being sent, and confirmed both HTML and plaintext parts were in there. \r\n\r\nHowever, what I wasn't aware of was this little line in [RFC 2046](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt):\r\n>In general, user agents that compose \"multipart/alternative\" entities\r\n   must place the body parts in increasing order of preference, that is,\r\n   with the preferred format last.  [..] Receiving user agents should pick and display the last format\r\n   they are capable of displaying.\r\n\r\nAha! So I checked the order of my mime parts, and, lo and behold, the plaintext part was being sent last! So Gmail was following the spec correctly - it was displaying the last format it was capable of displaying. (Side note: other mail clients seem to display HTML regardless).\r\n\r\nNow, what the heck was actually setting this order? I read through the ActionMailer documentation and discovered the `[:parts_order]` option. Great! All I have to do is set this and it'll work fine. Nope. After about a day worth of digging and frustration, I discovered that passing a block to `mail` sets the parts order to the same order as the block!\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes `mail` to respect `:parts_order` regardless of the order of any block passed into `mail`. I decided this change, rather than just clarifying the documentation, was appropriate for several reasons:\r\n  * It wasn't clear what should happen when `:parts_order` and the order of the block conflicted. Which should take precedence?\r\n  * Setting the mime part order in two places seemed unnecessarily confusing.\r\n  * When an email is multipart, I can think of few reasons why html would *not* be the preferred format. It seems too easy to accidentally send an email you *think* will show up as HTML but actually will be plaintext (this is what happened to me). `:parts_order` already sets a sensible default (html last), so let's make it difficult to unintentionally mess up this setting.\r\n  * In ActionController, the convention when writing an explicit block is put `format.html` first in the order of possible formats. This is how most examples/documentation is written. In ActionMailer, in order for HTML to actually display in an end user's mail client, you have to do the opposite. Flipping this convention in ActionMailer seems unneccessary.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this change. I lost about a day or two figuring this one out, just want to prevent anyone from having the same issue.",

    "body": "As stated here, changing the implementation of FlashHash can break people's sessions.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/flash.rb#L73-76\r\n\r\nThis happened between Rails 2 and 3, and the ivars have again changed since 3.2, for example replacing `@used` with `@discard`.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch avoids this issue altogether by mapping the flash object onto a simple data structure for storage in the session. The intention is that this representation remain stable while still allowing the implementation to change, without invalidating existing sessions.",

With this patch, it's now possible to provide that option directly to `respond_with`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrespond_to :json\r\n\r\ndef update\r\n  @user.update_attributes(params[:user])\r\n  respond_with(@user, full_messages: true)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve the following output:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"errors\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"Name cannot be blank.\" } }\r\n```",

    "body": "On master, when a default value is given for a postgres network address type (inet, cidr, macaddr), the output of the schema.rb dump is incorrect:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nt.inet     \"dns_address\",     default: #<IPAddr: IPv4:172.22.10.4/255.255.255.255>,   null: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue, outputting them as strings. It also fixes the tests so that the network address tests actually run- previously the regexes didn't match and thus never asserted that the columns were in the schema dump at all.\r\n\r\nA couple things that are suboptimal about this patch:\r\n* The ipaddr stdlib is required now for all adapters, not just postgres. I don't think this is a serious issue in real-world deployments (actionpack requires it, for instance). The alternative would be to develop a postgres-specific implementation of ColumnDumper, and that seems difficult.\r\n* We're now duplicating the logic for pulling a subnet mask out of an IPAddr in two places. We should probably monkey-patch IPAddr in activesupport. That's another patch, however.",

(Removed\r\n  establish_connection call from some tasks since in those cases\r\n  the :environment task already made sure the function would be called)\r\n- updated Resolver so that when it resolves the database url, it\r\n  removes hash values with empty strings from the config spec (e.g.\r\n  to support connection to postgresql when no username is specified).\r\n- updated ResolverTest to use current_adapter? to check the type of\r\n  the current adapter.\r\n\r\n(note: this backport is slightly different from master due to update to ResolverTest to make sure the tests get run when the adapter is mysql.)",
