This means that your `# TODO:` and other annotations in files such as `db/seeds.rb` are ignored unless this folder is included explicitly via the `SOURCE_ANNOTATION_DIRECTORIES` environment variable. I believe `db` should instead be included by default.\n\nThis pull request includes `db` in the default list of annotation folders.",

Now that we have MiniTest at our disposal, we should use its features to clean up the tests.\n\nThis is a cosmetic change but I believe it makes the tests easier to read, in the same way that `unless` is often (but not always) preferable to `if !`.",

Rails already correctly specifies the :type of any enumerable\nassociation (e.g. a has_many association), but made no attempt to do so for\nnon-enumerables (e.g. a has_one association).\nWe must specify the :type of any STI association. A has_one\nassociation to a class which uses single-table inheritance is an example of\nthis type of association.\n\nFixes #7471",

However, gems will not be built at all if\nrequire_paths is empty (see https://gist.github.com/1065473), so\nit's better to stick with the default, which does not have any\nside-effects",

    "body": "mysql and mysql2 session parameters can be set in the new 'set_session:' parameter in database.yml. The key-value pairs of this hash will be sent in a 'SET key = value, ...' query on new database connections.\n\nConsolidated the configure_connection methods from mysql and mysql2 into the abstract_mysql base class.\n\nExample use case, database.yml:\n\n```yaml\nproduction:\n  adapter: mysql2\n  database: foo_prod\n  user: foo\n  set_session:\n    sql_mode: traditional\n    default_week_format: 1\n```\n\nSee http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/set-statement.html and http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html\n\nI originally wanted to remove the new 'strict: boolean' parameter, and run sql_mode just from the set_session section, but turns out that strict mode also cleans up some column value behavior within the mysql adapters. So the intersection of strict and set_session sql_mode is that when strict is true, you better not override sql_mode to a setting that is less-strict -- however you _can_ override it to a value that is more strict (e.g. TRADITIONAL includes strict-mode's STRICT_ALL_TABLES plus adds a few more strictness options that many people might like!).",
