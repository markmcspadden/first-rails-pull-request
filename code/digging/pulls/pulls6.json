    "body": "WIP\r\n\r\nThe source issue is: #8672\r\n\r\nThis PR is only a failing test case as I am not completely sure how to tackle the problem.\r\n\r\nI investigated and can confirm that the order in which `after_create` and `has_and_belongs_to_many` associations are defined does impact the functionality.\r\n\r\nIf the callback is defined before the association every HABTM record created inside the callback will be inserted twice. The reason is `AutosaveAssociation#save_collection_association`. It will pick up the already created records and save them again. This happens because `@new_record_before_save` will be true and since it's an `after_create` callback, the associations are inserted directly with `<<`.\r\n\r\nMy test case results in the following failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1) Failure:\r\ntest_after_create_before_habtm_definition(HasAndBelongsToManyAssociationsTest) [test/cases/associations/has_and_belongs_to_many_associations_test.rb:616]:\r\nExpected: 1\r\n  Actual: 2\r\n```",

The default editor is now `GUI_EDITOR`, and falls back to `EDITOR`.\r\n\r\nIt wraps Thor's `template` and `copy_file` actions, and opens generated/copied files in your text editor if `options[\"editor\"]` is present.\r\n\r\nP.S. I initially tried to just open the main generated files, but I think it's better to just open them all. If you run the model generator, you'll probably want to edit the migration, model, and tests. (Instead of just the model.)\r\n",

    "body": "This is my attempt to start the implementation of automatically derived inverse associations. I was heavily inspired this [this](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6161#issuecomment-7238602) comment. As it turns out, the problem seems to be quite difficult to solve.\r\n\r\n6722292 and 904dc21 are essentially the automatic inverse implementation. The other 3 commits are attempting to fix failing tests out of the automatic derivation of inverses.\r\n\r\nI've struggled for several days to figure out all the interesting problems that this implementation has presented, but finally I'm choosing to submit it to the community so that we can come to the right solution together!\r\n\r\nThe primary issue seems to be how to identify when inverses are not appropriate. Its easy to guess what the inverse might be, but its apparent to me now that there are a lot of places they just shouldn't or can't exist. So assuming there will be an inverse can lead to bad things :). I ran into a lot of issues like #7250 #653 #7809, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to deliver known failing commits, but perhaps this can spur process of developing this feature to completion!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBasically I decided to stop and submit because 1) I've started going in circles 2) I've spent way more time on this than planned 3) I thought it'd benefit from the community.",

    "body": "*This is a new version of broken #7688*\n\nIt was decided two year ago in c96a505391 that \"update_attribute should not update readonly attributes\". I believe it's missleading and should be changed.\n\nI wrote an issue asking whether it's normal or not: rails/rails/issues/7679. As you can see, it was recommended to me to try sending pull request.\n\nReasons I believe `update_attribute`, `update_column` and `update_columns` should update readonly attributes:\n\n 1. All validations are skipped in this methods. Readonly check really looks like validation.\n 2. `update_attribute` is kind of more 'raw' version of `=` operator, but in this case I can do\n\n ```ruby\n minivan.color = 'new_color'\n minivan.save\n ```\n\n without getting exceptions, but can't do\n\n ```ruby\n minivan.update_attribute :color, 'new_color'\n ```\n\n It's pretty weird, in this case `=` behaves more raw than `update_attribute`.\n\n 3. Readonly control is relatively low-level:\n\n ```ruby\n# Filters the primary keys and readonly attributes from the attribute names.\n   def attributes_for_update(attribute_names)\n     attribute_names.select do |name|\n       column_for_attribute(name) && !pk_attribute?(name) && !readonly_attribute?(name)\n     end\n   end\n ```\n And here is one more oddity: we don't raise exception for `pk_attribute`, but do for `readonly_attribute` in `update_attribute`, `update_column` and `update_columns`.\n\nI'm open for discussion. Please, let me know where I'm wrong :)\n\n  \n\n\n",

    "body": "Right now we have a default error handling app `ActionDispatch::PublicExceptions` that renders the static 404 & 500 pages. If you don't like it you can override this behavior by specifying an exceptions app in the config of your application using `config.exceptions_app`. Right now if you do so, and you have an exception in your exceptions app, your users will not see your 404 or 500 pages, but instead a FAILSAFE_RESPONSE that simply renders some text.\n\nThis change gives the ability to have MULTIPLE fallback apps. So anyone can write exception handling apps, and if those apps fail, it will continue to try to use the public app. This design also allows the developer to specify additional apps if they choose.\n\nThere are two key things in this PR, first that this fallback behavior to the public exceptions app is automatic, and second that by default you can specify multiple error rendering apps.\n\nThis is an alternative implementation of an existing PR #7804 made at the behest of @jeremy. I believe this is a cleaner implementation.\n\nATP railties and actionpack cc/ @rafael @rafaelfranca @spastorino @steveklabnik",

I assume that other save\nrelated callbacks are also being triggered which might be undesirable.\n    \nThe same problem was fixed for belongs_to records in rails@658bb4f for an old lightouse ticket - https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3353",

    "body": "There are cases where applications or frameworks that use Active Model would like to validate that members of array fields include or exclude specific values. This is natural given the language used in these validations, but the current implementation is only one-sided:\n\n*\"Validate that the attribute is any of these values (includes) or none of these values (excludes).\"*\n\nWhat this pull request does is expand this language to include:\n\n*\"Validate that the attribute is any of or contains any of these values (includes) or is not or does not include any of these values (excludes).\"*\n\nThe added test cases show the expectations of what this means, but I will also put examples here. First a model for the examples.\n\n```ruby\nclass Code\n  include ActiveModel::Validations\n  include ActiveModel::Validations::Callbacks\n\n  attr_accessor :letters, :numbers\n\n  def initialize(attributes)\n    attributes.each do |key, value|\n      send \"#{key}=\", value\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Validate that letters contains any of the values a, b, or c.\n  validates_inclusion_of :letters, :in => [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" ]\n\n  # Validate that numbers contains none of the values 1, 2, or 3.\n  validates_exclusion_of :numbers, :in => [ 1, 2, 3 ]\nend\n```\n\nExpectations:\n\n```ruby\nCode.new(:letters => [ \"a\" ]).valid? #=> true\nCode.new(:letters => [ \"a\", \"b\" ]).valid? #=> true\nCode.new(:letters => [ \"a\", \"c\" ]).valid? #=> true\nCode.new(:letters => [ \"z\", \"d\" ]).valid? #=> false\n\nCode.new(:numbers => [ 1 ]).valid? #=> false\nCode.new(:numbers => [ 1, 3 ]).valid? #=> false\nCode.new(:numbers => [ 5, 6 ]).valid? #=> true\n```\n\nBoth the `allow_nil` and `allow_blank` options would function as normal here as well. \n\nLet me know what you think - I would love to have this functionality in core Active Model for Rails 4 in of course you think it makes sense. Otherwise perhaps a discussion around this would be lovely as well. :)\n\nFor the tests I followed the conventions of the existing tests for those two classes.",

It does check against the db for duplicate records but doesn't check the collection being passed in. This checks for that only when there is a uniqueness validation defined in the associated model.\n\nIt is a basic uniqueness validation by combining the attributes defined in the uniqueness validator. I've chosen to only pull the necessary attributes to generate the \"key\" instead of all attributes https://github.com/jeyb/rails/commit/1f618ff24e284e6aad15da43952ed3d45cc1d621 in case there are timestamps that or other user generated content that throws off the uniqueness check.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

    "body": "This little feature arose from an actual application where an object hierarchy did not correspond to the database mapping. Instead of establishing a new connection in each model, and creating multiple connection pools and connections, this change allows one model to delegate its connection to another model.\n\nExample:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base; end\n    class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base; end\n\n    class RegularUser < User\n      establish_connection(:regular_db)\n    end\n\n    class SuperUser < User\n      establish_connection(:super_db)\n    end\n\n    class RegularProfile < Profile\n      share_connnection(RegularUser)\n    end\n\n    class SuperProfile < Profile\n      share_connection(SuperUser)\n    end\n\nIn this example it does not make sense to create a superclass called `RegularDB` that both `RegularUser` and `RegularProfile` inherit from because that does not correspond at all with the object hierarchy. It's much more intuitive to have a top level `User` class, and then simply share the appropriate connection. This also enforces a separation between the database connection and the object hierarchy.",

    "body": "Multi-parameter attributes (used to build a complex type like a `Date` from several simple values that can be easily POSTed) are currently implemented in `ActiveRecord::AttributeAssignment`. This is pretty frustrating if you're trying to use an `ActiveModel::Model` with `Date` or `DateTime` fields.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this by moving multi-parameter conversion to the `ActionController::Parameters` class, so it happens before the value hits the model. IMO the model layer shouldn't need to be aware of the format that's used to pass the data from the client to the server.\r\n\r\nTo support this the type that the values should be re-assembled into is included in the form (e.g. `<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"my_model[created_at(type)]\" value=\"Date\">`) instead of being determined from the model schema.\r\n\r\nThe main aim was to get multi-parameter attributes working with `ActiveModel`, but a nice side effect of this implementation is that it becomes very easy to register custom types. For example, you could easily submit an amount of money as a currency and an amount and have it converted to your own custom `Money` class:\r\n\r\n        # In an initializer somewhere:\r\n        ActionController::MultiParameterConverter.register_type('Money') { |currency, amount|\r\n          Money.new(currency, amount)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        # View:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"my_model[price(1)]\" value=\"$\">\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"my_model[price(2f)]\" value=\"50.00\">\r\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"my_model[price(type)]\" value=\"Money\">\r\n\r\nThis isn't a finished implementation yet. It needs documentation, and the `ActiveRecord` implementation needs to be deprecated or removed. I've added multi-parameter support to `ActionController` and updated the `date_select`, `datetime_select` and `time_select` helpers to use the new implementation. I figured this was far enough to get some feedback.",

    "body": "Hey @spastorino,\r\n\r\nThis has created a regression in how paths are eager loaded:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/53778ec2d716f860646fd43957fd53c8db4da2fe\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think there's anything wrong with this commit.... I'll explain more:\r\n\r\nBefore the above commit:\r\n\r\n ?> pp Rails.configuration.paths.eager_load\r\n[\"/home/jsharpe/project/app/assets\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/controllers\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/helpers\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/models\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/modules\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/structs\",\r\n \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/workers\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the commit:\r\n\r\n?> pp Rails.configuration.paths.eager_load\r\n [\"/home/jsharpe/project/app/controllers\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/helpers\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/models\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/modules\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/structs\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app/workers\",\r\n  \"/home/jsharpe/project/app\"]\r\n  \r\n\r\nNote that /assets is now missing from #eager_load - which was the intent of the patch.  However, /app is now included when it wasn't before.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that it was a bug before the commit that /app was missing.  It is set to be eager_load => true here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-rel/railties/lib/rails/engine/configuration.rb#L42\r\n\r\nNow that /app is (correctly) part of eager_load, it now automatically loads anything inside of /app - including things that are specifically intended not be loaded.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I do this in config/ application.rb:\r\n\r\nconfig.paths.add('app/manifests', :eager_load => false)\r\n\r\nthen files located in app/manifests are loaded - and that I believe is a regression.  The attached patch fixes that.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to set up the rails test suite up and running, but I wanted to at least start this conversation.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
