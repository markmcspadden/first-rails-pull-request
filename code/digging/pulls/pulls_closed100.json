I tracked it down and it seems to be related to a workaround that existed only for 1.9.3-p0, that loaded all possible conversions beforehand. This workaround does not get executed on p125, and the related test broke.\r\n\r\nThis has changed for 3.1, so I just cherry-picked the commits that removed the workaround and fixed the test. \r\n\r\nThanks!",

I had to change a little bit the implementation of the FixtureResolver to avoid calling `hash.select {}.each` - it also is more similar to [the implementation in 3-1 forward](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-1-stable/actionpack/lib/action_view/testing/resolvers.rb#L30-36).\r\n\r\nThese rjs tests [were completely removed in 3-1 together with `render :update`](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/eea66892c80d51c1b959171c2e3feac67124aaba). And I didn't find any other test that uses FixtureResolver relying on ordering like this one.\r\n\r\nLet me know if something needs improvement. Thanks.",

It's currently green on travis by chance, due to randomly errors happening on Ruby 1.8.7 p538.\r\n\r\n[Branch 3-1 on travis actually showed up the error related to cookie store tests](http://travis-ci.org/#!/rails/rails/jobs/932944).\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this is to ensure the session hash that will be used to set the cookie value by rack shouldn't change, whereas right now it returns a new hash object every time `set_session` is called. With the random hash change in Ruby 1.8.7, it was causing the failures when testing against the generated `Set-Cookie` header.\r\n\r\nGiven this is applied and 3-2 tests pass, I'll send to 3-1 as well - and I think the same patch could be applied later to master as it makes sense to not return a different object.\r\n\r\n/cc @josevalim @spastorino",

There's no work done to force\r\nthe url generators to use that field when passed a model, but since to_param\r\nis already overridable I don't think it's necessary.\r\n\r\nPatch includes tests for a plain resource as well as a nested resource\r\n(generating user_login for the above example).",
