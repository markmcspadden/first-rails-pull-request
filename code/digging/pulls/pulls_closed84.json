I've moved it to a class to remove duplication and add tests.\n\nIt seems that the original intention was that all these methods of setting the environment should be supported. (Plus it makes it consistent with other commands.)\n\n```term\n$ rails c --help\nUsage: console [environment] [options]\n    -s, --sandbox                    Rollback database modifications on exit.\n    -e, --environment=name           Specifies the environment to run this console under (test/development/production).\n                                     Default: development\n        --debugger                   Enable the debugger.\n```\n\nSee also https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3949 which this pull request replaces.",
