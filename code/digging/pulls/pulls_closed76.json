    "body": "When I have incoming request with `:html` format and I want to render some json(using jbuilder for example), I put render :partial into my layout/template directly. It looks like: `render partial: \"something\", formats: :json`. But when this partial contain `json.partial!` then I have error that partial cannot be found and formats contain only `:html`. Guys from my team often using back situation, when incoming format :json, and they need to return a few rendered partials in that json, they using render partial: \"name\", formats: :html, and format will be missing on the second render :partial. I've implemented adding new formats to lookup context.",

This form (\"//cdn.host/blah/foo.css\") allows the same content to be served (and cached) for both normal and secure sites, leaving the user agent to resolve the protocol.\n\nCurrently, the asset host plumbing doesn't recognize this as a valid URI form (it is, says RFC 3986 section 4.2).  If I specify my asset host of \"//a.example.com/assets\", loading asset \"foo.png\" results in an invalid URI \"http:////a.example.com/assets/foo.png\" on HTTP and \"https:////a.example.com/assets/foo.png\" on HTTPS.\n\nThis patch correctly recognizes my protocol-less URI as valid and doesn't attempt to add the proto.",

So let me push my test case alone.",

    "body": "This pull is against 3-2-stable, not master.  If accepted, I'll quickly put together a pull for master, as well.\n\nPolymorphic routes currently only use `arg.to_model` when [generating the path directory or name portion](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L100) of a route. They do not use the `to_param` value from the delegated model for the generated route IDs (since it currently [passes the arguments directly](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L127) to the named route functions without converting them to models).\n\nSince `to_model` is supposed to act as the ActiveModel stand-in for an object, and the polymorphic routing mechanism already takes `to_model` in to account for a small bit of it, I think this is a bug in the router to not fully follow through with its usage.  It also significantly limits the usefulness of creating `to_model` stand-ins.\n\nSo, this pull has a test to exploit the bug where I exercise that the delegate is not currently being used for to_param.  And, then the fix simply passes the args collection after having converted it to models.",
