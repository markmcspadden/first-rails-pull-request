    "body": "This is in response to the discussion at https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7241\r\n\r\nI think an `each_with_hash` method would be a very useful addition. It provides a nice shortcut for the common `each_with_object({})`, but it also supports setting a default value or proc for the Hash. It also provides a shortcut for a common use of `Hash.new( <proc> )`, which is setting the default value on a hash key when it is looked up. Here's an example of how you could write less code using that feature:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# using each_with_object:\r\n\r\n[1,2,3,2].each_with_object(Hash.new(&-> hash, key { hash[key] = [] })) {|el, hash| hash[el] << el ** 2 }\r\n#=> {1=>[1], 2=>[4, 4], 3=>[9]}\r\n\r\n# using each_with_hash:\r\n\r\n[1,2,3,2].each_with_hash([], true) {|hash, el| hash[el] << el ** 2}\r\n#=> {1=>[1], 2=>[4, 4], 3=>[9]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to easily use `<<` with arrays, instead of having to write `hash[el] += [el ** 2]`.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this gets merged, it would be awesome if it could also be included in `3-2-stable`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "When setting an array column (or other PostgreSQL-specific data type) to be validated for uniqueness, the resulting SQL query is generated with syntax errors, like this:\r\n\r\nSELECT  1 AS one FROM \"postgresql_arrays\"  WHERE \"postgresql_arrays\".\"nicknames\" = '[\"john\", \"johnny\"]' LIMIT 1\r\n\r\nThis happens because Ruby Arrays must be type-casted to their PostgreSQL equivalent.  This small patch fixes this issue, calling the adapter's type_cast method.\r\n\r\nI have added a test case for this, but since it's PostgreSQL-specific (it skips for other adapters), I'm not sure if it belongs in the validate_uniqueness_test.rb or if I should put it with other PostgreSQL tests.\r\n\r\nThanks,",

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nHere is a fix for find_in_batches when Model#id is a string. In fact when calling find_in_batches (or find_each) without the start option it generates a wrong SQL statement:\r\n\r\n    Subscriber.find_each { |subscriber| ...  }\r\n    # Generates SQL:\r\n    # SELECT  \"subscribers\".* FROM \"subscribers\"  WHERE (\"subscribers\".\"nick\" >= 0) ...\r\n\r\nThat statement is invalid with strict databases such as PostgreSQL, because it tries to compare a string against an integer.\r\n\r\nWith more tolerant databases such as SQLite it's passing, but in fact it skips IDs starting with a lower character than '0'.\r\n\r\nOnce accepted and merged, I plan to backport that fix in pull request #7987 for rails 3.2.\r\n\r\ncc @spastorino",

This method redefined the primary key multiple times, wich of course raised exceptions with the patch. I looked over the tests for `copy_table` and made some additions to lock the current behavior down before refactoring (I think it would be good to glance over to make sure I didn't forget anything).\r\n\r\nAlso there might be a better description for the error message, just leave a comment if you got a better text.\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for #6378",
