    "body": "This pull request concerns Issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/776. \r\n\r\nI handle memory bloat by having the transaction hold only the AR objects which it absolutely needs to know about. These are the AR objects with callbacks (they need to be updated as soon as something in the transaction occurs). \r\n\r\nAll other AR objects can be updated lazily by keeping a reference to a TransactionState object. If an AR object is inside a transaction, then the transaction will add its TransactionState to the AR object. When the user makes a call to some attribute on an AR object (which has no callbacks) associated with a transaction, the AR object will call the sync_with_transaction_state method and make sure it is up to date with the transaction. After it has synced with the transaction state, the AR object will return the attribute that was requested.\r\n\r\nMost of the logic in the changes are used to handle multiple transactions, in which case the AR object has to recursively follow parent pointers of TransactionState objects.

    "body": "Pertains to issue 776: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/776. \r\n\r\nI created a universally unique identifier (uuid) for all activerecord objects which are associated with transactions. Each transaction contains a set of uuids of AR objects. This means that there are no direct references to the AR objects themselves so they can get garbage collected. On callbacks and rollbacks, I used the ObjectSpace to find all live AR objects and see if their uuid is contained within the transaction.\r\n\r\nNote that this fix doesn't work in JRuby because ObjectSpace doesn't exist there. Later I'll be creating a TransactionRecord object which holds a uuid and an AR object, so that ObjectSpace can filter by only transaction records and iterate over a much smaller set to improve performance.\r\n\r\nAlso added some tests for transaction memory bloat and removed the now unneeded TransactionState object and its associated tests.",

    "body": "While testing a Rails 4 app in semi-production, I noticed that CSRF protection threw exceptions on HEAD requests by crawler bots.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Shall I make a pull request that adds support for a HEAD request in the csrf protection code? Should we find a way to convert HEAD -> GET just like in Rails <4.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering, I read in the CHANGELOG that `ActionDispatch::Head` was replaced in favor of `Rack::Head` by  Santiago Pastorino. `ActionDispatch::Head` converted a HEAD to a GET request like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    def call(env)\r\n      if env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"HEAD\"\r\n        env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] = \"GET\"\r\n        env[\"rack.methodoverride.original_method\"] = \"HEAD\"\r\n        status, headers, _ = @app.call(env)\r\n        [status, headers, []]\r\n      else\r\n        @app.call(env)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever. `Rack::Head` middleware does not do this HEAD -> GET conversion in https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/head.rb.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    if env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"HEAD\"\r\n      body.close if body.respond_to? :close\r\n      [status, headers, []]\r\n    else\r\n      [status, headers, body]\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could easily add a `request.head?` in `valid_request?` to support this. But somehow I feel there are more reasons and code that depends on HEAD requests being converted to GETs.\r\n\r\nAdded a failing test for now.",

    "body": "Setting the `Time.zone` in an `after_initialize` block can become a problem for people upgrading, since it's not going to be available when `config/initializers` run, and people might be relying on it.\r\n    \r\nAn example that I noticed was with the [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), for date/time parsing. It requires us [to configure the time class to be Time.zone](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#time-zones), and doing that in an initializer no longer worked with these changes.\r\n\r\nExample code in `config/initializers/chronic.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nChronic.time_class = Time.zone\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had to change to this to make it work with the locale change:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.configuration.after_initialize do\r\n  Chronic.time_class = Time.zone\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though I think it'd be good to move the locale options, I don't think this change should affect people relying on the current behavior, so it seems safer to revert now.\r\n\r\n*I'm sending as a pull request to get some feedback from @steveklabnik and @rafaelfranca, to check if I'm not forgetting to revert anything else*.",

After introduction of\r\nassets pipeline this is not needed as all of the assets are served or\r\ncompiled into main application's assets.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the obsolete line making asset_path always generate\r\npaths relative to the root or config.relative_url_root if it's set.\r\n\r\n(closes #8119)\r\n```",
