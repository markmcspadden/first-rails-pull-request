    "body": "Prepared statements (prepare/execute/close) were being used unnecessarily\nwhen no bind variables were present, and disabling prepared statement using\nprepared_statements:false was principally broken. While bind variables were\ncorrectly substituted with prepared_statements:false, the prepared statement\ninterface was still used, costing an extra two round trips per query.\n\nIn addition to making this behavioral change, I also cleaned up the internals\nof exec_stmt and exec_without_stmt so that they behave the same (calling log\nand constructing the ActiveRecord::Result in the same way).\n\nMoving the check for binds.empty? to exec_query also will mean that several\ncode paths explicitly calling exec_without_stmt could be cleaned up to once\nagain call exec_query instead. I have also left the check for binds.empty? in\nexec_stmt, since it is not a private method and could be called directly with\nan empty binds array. For the sake of clarity in this patch, I have not made\nthose changes.\n\n# The previous behavior #\n\nWhen issuing a Foo.find(1) with prepared_statements:true, the bind variable\nis present in the prepared query, and execute shows a value passed:\n\n    Connect\troot@localhost on rails_test\n    Query\tSET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0\n    Statistics\n    Query\tSHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `foos`\n    Query\tSHOW TABLES LIKE 'foos'\n    Query\tSHOW CREATE TABLE `foos`\n    Prepare\tSELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = ? LIMIT 1\n    Execute\tSELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1\n    Close stmt\n    Quit\n\nWhen issuing a Foo.find(1) with prepared_statements:false, the bind variable\nhas already been removed and substituted with the value, but the prepared\nstatement interface is used anyway:\n\n    Connect\troot@localhost on rails_test\n    Query\tSET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0\n    Statistics\n    Query\tSHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `foos`\n    Query\tSHOW TABLES LIKE 'foos'\n    Query\tSHOW CREATE TABLE `foos`\n    Prepare\tSELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1\n    Execute\tSELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1\n    Close stmt\n    Quit\n\n# With this patch applied #\n\nWhen issuing a Foo.find(1) with prepared_statements:true, the bind variable\nis present in the prepared query, and execute shows a value passed:\n\n    Connect\troot@localhost on rails_test\n    Query\tSET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0\n    Statistics\n    Query\tSHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `foos`\n    Query\tSHOW TABLES LIKE 'foos'\n    Query\tSHOW CREATE TABLE `foos`\n    Prepare\tSELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = ?

    "body": "These allow you to declare a mapping from generated column names to simplified\ndatabase column types (i.e. those used in migrations). This way scopes with\ncolumns generated in their select lists can also include the information as to what\nform that data takes. This saves the user from having to translate the data\nfrom a sql string wherever it's used.\n\nHere's an example of where I'd use this:\n\n```ruby\n\nclass Topic < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :replies\n  scope :by_most_recently_replied, joins(:replies).group('topics.id')\n      .select('topics.*, MAX(replies_topics.written_on) AS latest_reply_written_on')\n      .order('latest_reply_written_on DESC').cast(latest_reply_written_on: :datetime)\nend\n\n>> topic = Topic.by_most_recently_replied.first\n>> topic.latest_reply_written_on.class\n=> Time\n```\n\nThe cast is applied to postgres columns only when there is no OID info for the column.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Remaining work is to test handling of binary data - not quite sure how to go about that but I don't expect any surprises.",
