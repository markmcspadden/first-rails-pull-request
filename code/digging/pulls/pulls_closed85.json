I think that it should be fine as this becomes new target anyway, but maybe I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to return new collection object, but target seems better as that's what you also get in `replace` in ruby.\r\n\r\n/cc @tenderlove @jonleighton",

This change prevents the slow query explain from running if the connection adapter does not support it. Ideally, the test wouldn't stub out 'supports_explain?' on a connection that does indeed support it, but we don't yet have any tests that run end-to-end against a jruby runtime and use the jdbc drivers.\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated!\r\n\r\nBlake",
