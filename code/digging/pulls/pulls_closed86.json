    "body": "`constantize` is meant to avoid looking up in `Object`, e.g. so that `\"String::Fixnum\".constantize` raises an error.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ancestor chain is not looked up at all.\r\n\r\n    class A\r\n      Foo = :bar\r\n    end\r\n    class B < A\r\n    end\r\n    \"B::Foo\".constantize # => raises an error, should return B::Foo (which is == A::Foo)\r\n\r\nI ran into this when registering an observer (say \"some_class/observer\"), where `SomeClass::Observer` is defined in a base class of `SomeClass`. That currently fails, as `Observer` has to be defined directly in `SomeClass`.\r\n\r\nOne solution is for me to write:\r\n\r\n    class SomeClass < SomeBaseClass\r\n      Observer = Observer # to satisfy Rails constantize lookup!!\r\n    end\r\n\r\nI hope you appreciate the irony :-)\r\n\r\nI feel that there is no reason for `constantize` to be so strict, though. The attached patch fixes this.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

No implementation has been provided for Date (beginning_of_hour and end_of_hour for a Date seems nonsensical).\r\n\r\nWhile this feature has been based on master, I'm more than happy to submit it against 3-2-stable for any future 3.2.x release.\r\n\r\nFor anybody wanting to monkey patch their existing Rails applications with this code, take this gist and place in an initializer: https://gist.github.com/2595181",

In #6012 I covered db console with tests and we can now improve it a little.\r\n\r\nThe first commit - abort if we execute `rails db` on memory dtabase. The second - to use rails root expand path as here: [connection_adapters/sqlite3_adapter.rb#L21](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite3_adapter.rb#L21).\r\n\r\nThe first improvment I found only investigating code, but the second is from real life. I developed gem and executed dummy server `./spec/dummy/scripts/rails server`. It worked well. But  `./spec/dummy/scripts/rails db` failed with not resolved path to db file.",

According to rack-lint the content-type header must not be present for 1xx, 204, 205, and 304. I was getting weird 500s in our app because responses were blowing up in rack-lint. This commit fixes that. All the other tests pass.",
