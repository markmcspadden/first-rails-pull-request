    "body": "First, I've deferred the instantiating of a ``Rails::Application`` instance. Before an object was being initialized as soon as you created a subclass of ``Rails::Application``, whereas it makes much more sense to wait for an explicit initialization.\r\n\r\nThe ``Rails.application`` variable will now get set on the first initialization of a ``Rails::Application`` instance. This paves the way to allow you to do a lot of things before you actually instantiated the application.\r\n\r\nI've also added a feature where you can clone the application so that it shares the same configuration, routes, helpers, etc. This is part of a larger railties update that is coming up, but it this batch of code is sufficiently small and doesn't change that much functionality.",

This Pull Request is going to fix that by introducing a list of columns that should always be saved if their were changed or not. \r\n\r\n__dirty_attribute_names__ is a class variable added to __dirty.rb__.\r\nIf a column name will be added to that list all then AR will always update that attribute. \r\n\r\nPotentially the __serialized_attributes__ may be managed with __dirty_attribute_names__ so we can have only one way to deal with those things. \r\n\r\nTested over ruby-2.0.0-p0 and postgresql 9.2.3.",

    "body": "Similar to @tenderlove's ed9e3f699ab3fac01ad9ef038847d1cdd4c9f063, this pull request swaps out `class_eval` of strings for dynamic methods, and replaces it using either `define_method` or `delegate`.\r\n\r\nI originally wrote this in January, for use in RubyMotion which doesn't support string eval. I didn't create a PR because at the time it seemed the preference was to use string eval when generating dynamic methods. If this is no longer the case, then perhaps there is interest in these changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR leaves `callbacks.rb` and `core_ext/module/delegation.rb` untouched. Rewriting their use of string eval would cause the code to be quite a bit less readable.\r\n\r\nI ran the tests using ruby 2.0.0p0.",

    "body": "Currently, json/encoding respects the JSON spec (as it should) which disallows \\n and \\r inside strings, escaping them as expected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, ECMA-262 (Javascript) disallows not only \\n and \\r in strings, but \"Line Terminators\" which includes U+2028 and U+2029. See here: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.3\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds U+2028 and U+2029 to be escaped.\r\n\r\n# Why? \r\n\r\nIt's very common to see something like this in a Rails template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\nvar posts = <%= @posts.to_json %>;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf U+2028 or U+2029 are part of any attributes output in the to_json call, you will end up with an exception. In Chrome: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if one of your users pastes something into a textarea that happens to include these fancy unicode line terminators, and you run to_json on that model and stick it in a template, that page is probably broken now.\r\n\r\n# Why not?\r\n\r\nThis is JSON encoding, and the JSON spec is specific about how to encode strings. U+2028 and U+2029 don't get special treatment.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is non-obvious, counterintuitive, and can be tough to debug (https://www.google.com/?q=u2028). \r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your apps to deal with this? Is there a convention I'm missing?",

    "body": "This class is an initial implementation of HTML5 SSE for rails. Currently we provide 2 kinds of ways to implement a SSE server. The first is controller level SSE, in which we do not distinguish clients and will send data to all the clients that subscribe the same sse source.\r\nThe second is client level SSE, which we DO distinguish clients and the data sent to different client can be totally different.\r\n\r\n## Controlller level SSE:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MySSE < ActionController::Base\r\n  include ActionController::Live\r\n  include ActionController::ServerSentEvents\r\n  extend ActionController::ServerSentEvents::ClassMethods\r\nend\r\n```\r\nin this way, an action named ```sse_source``` will be created automaticlly and you can use ```MySSE.send_sse``` or ```MySSE.send_sse_hash``` to send event to all clients that subscribed the sse_source (you should register the action in route.rb manually)\r\n\r\n## Client level SSE(Session awared):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MySSE < ActionController::Base\r\n  include ActionController::Live\r\n  include ActionController::ServerSentEvents\r\n\r\n  def event\r\n    start_serve do |sse_client|\r\n      # we can access some session variables here\r\n      sse_client.send_sse sse\r\n      sse_client.send_sse_hash :data => \"david\"\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nPlease note that Controller level SSE and Client level SSE are not meant to\r\nwork together in the same controller.\r\n",

And, why default name is 'authenticity_token'? (In fact CSRF is about authorization, not authentication. So, this naming sucks).\r\n\r\nI propose to have X-CSRF-Token and csrf_token as constant names for CSRF token. Yes, completely constant in code. Such things are never modified. \r\n\r\nIt is a speaking name and developers will understand what does it exactly do. I never understood where is \"authenticity\" part in authenticity_token.\r\n\r\np.s. PR is not done, what do you think? ",

It changes the behaviour so that the\r\nlongest suitable acronym is always used.",

However, the reasoning behind that was because a pretty cryptic error was thrown. The current behavior in Rails is that ``thing.update_attributes(nil)`` will return and not update any attributes without throwing any error.\r\n\r\nHowever, Instead of allowing you to send a nil argument, it might be better to raise an ``ArgumentError`` which has a clear error message. I've made that change here, but this PR is more intended as a discussion on which behavior is better.\r\n\r\nThis is in response to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9858.",

This creates an easy DOS attack against some load balancers just by hitting up and app over and over with invalid requests... you can pull the entire app offline... a more appropriate response code would be 400 - \"The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.\".\r\n\r\nThis commit makes this change.",

Likely they wanted to define a host `host: \"example.com\"` and a `protocol: \"http://\"` but did not know the convention.\r\n\r\nThis may not the most common problem, but when it happens it can go undetected for a while. I accidentally added `http://` out of habit recently only to find all the links in my emails were broken after deploying a demo site to production. Rather than allow this accident go undetected, we can fix the problem in line by properly setting the protocol and host.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was able to find this related question on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5878329/rails-3-devise-how-do-i-make-the-email-confirmation-links-use-secure-https-n where the answer was highly upvoted.\r\n\r\nThis is based off of work in #7415 cc/ @pixeltrix\r\n\r\nback port of #9794\r\n\r\nATP Action Mailer and Action Pack",
