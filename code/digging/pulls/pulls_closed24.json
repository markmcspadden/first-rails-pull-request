This is not a very helpful exception for this case.\r\n\r\nThis is a small change that provides a \"default\" DatabaseTasks implementation.

This was great news for those of us maintaining external connection adapters.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, three of the rake tasks in databases.rake still include a hard-coded gate on the adapter name. Only certain adapters (MySQL, Postgres, and Sqlite) get passed to DatabaseTasks, with the result that third party connection adapters are still locked out of providing implementations for those three tasks.\r\n\r\nThis is a small diff that removes the hard-coded adapter name check, and instead makes DatabaseTasks the default (fallback) implementation for those tasks. Therefore, now, when one of these three rake tasks are run:\r\n\r\n* For the main adapters (MySQL, Postgres, and Sqlite), this has no effect.\r\n* For third party adapters, this gives them a chance to run their code via DatabaseTasks\r\n* For \"unknown\" adapters where a rake task implementation is not provided, the behavior changes from an exception thrown out of databases.rake, to an exception thrown out of DatabaseTasks. Thus, it now matches the behavior of most of the rest of the other rake tasks.\r\n",

So if the user submitted the form, it would be saved to the database escaped instead of raw.",
