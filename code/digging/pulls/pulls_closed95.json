    "body": "When building an active record object from an association with parent.children.build, parent.build_child, or the equivalent with nested form attributes, this change allows you to pass the inheritance column attribute to specify the subclass when the associated class uses STI. e.g.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    parent.children.build(:type => \"OldestChild\")\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis has been the subject of a few other pull requests/issues, and has been closed out for security reasons. I believe this patch addresses those security issues by\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring that the class name is a valid class and that it is in the ancestors of the super class that the association is expecting. You cannot build any random object, it must be in the base association class's hierarchy.\r\n\r\n2. Respecting protected attributes. By default the inheritance column is protected. In order to build an association using a subclass, the inheritance column must be explicitly made accessible, either by overriding attributes_protected_by_default, or with attr_accessible.\r\n\r\nHere are the previously closed issues for reference:\r\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1686\r\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3749\r\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3750\r\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4130",

Two things I have done:\r\n\r\n* The options :conditions, :include, :extend cannot map directly on a method inRelation::QueryMethods. I made the subsitution explicit instead of filtering out the keys from the loop and performing the methods one by one after.\r\n* Extracted the filtering of the invalid and empty options for readability.\r\n\r\nAll ActiveRecord and Rails tests pass.\r\n\r\n**Deprecate?**\r\nI'd like to deprecate the three finder-options: :conditions, :include, :extend. This would mean a lot of (fairly simple) changes in code, test and documentation. Let me know what you think of this - I could add it to the PR.",
