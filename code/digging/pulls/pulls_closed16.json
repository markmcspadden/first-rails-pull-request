To ensure that content-managed pages cannot shadow routes defined by the developer, the dispatcher runs after the Rails application routes (checking for the `X-Cascade=pass` header).\r\n\r\nWith the Rails welcome page now implemented as a controller action, the route for `/` is always accessible in development mode, so the dispatcher cannot dispatch requests for `/`, meaning a CMS-managed home page cannot be viewed.",

There could be gem authors or app owners that used `#structure_dump`, which will no longer be available.\r\n\r\nI've also added a commit to issue a warning when `mysqldump` is not in the PATH.
