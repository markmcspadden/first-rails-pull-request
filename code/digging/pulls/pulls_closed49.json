The most common example would be `$ rails db:migrate`\r\n\r\nRather than telling the developer simply that they did not use a valid rails command, we can see if it was a valid rake command first. If it is a valid rake command we can auto execute it giving the user a period of time to cancel if that isn't what they intended.\r\n\r\nHere is what `rake db:migrate` would look like if you cancel the command:\r\n\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails db:migrate\r\nAssuming you meant: $ rake db:migrate \r\npress any key to cancel in 3 seconds\r\n> \r\ncommand terminated ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is what it looks like if you don't cancel the command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails db:migrate\r\nAssuming you meant: $ rake db:migrate \r\npress any key to cancel in 3 seconds\r\n> \r\nRunning: $ rake db:migrate \r\n==  Foo: migrating ============================================================\r\n==  Foo: migrated (0.0000s) ===================================================\r\n```",

If config.force_ssl is not set there will be no effect.\r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is that when you force SSL to be true you might forget to set your cookies to HTTPS only. If you forget to do this then your cookies are vulnerable when your users are on a unsafe connection, for example public wifi. This attack happens in the wild with Firesheep (http://codebutler.com/firesheep/). You can read more about this attack at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Cookie_theft_and_session_hijacking\r\n\r\nOf course some people will remember and configure the cookie correctly to prevent this attack. However I feel it is important to be secure by default. Default in this case means when a user forces SSL, if that is not set this PR will not change anything.",

If we call `#to_xml` on an instance of `Foo` we would get the following exception `NoMethodError (undefined method 'model_name'...`\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this issue would be to also make sure `Foo` also extend `ActiveModel::Naming`. Another way, which appear to be more robust, and more importantly, consistent with the rest of the codebase (i.e. already used in `ActiveModel::Serializers::JSON`) would be extend `ActiveModel::Naming` the moment `ActiveModel::Serializers::Xml` is included.
