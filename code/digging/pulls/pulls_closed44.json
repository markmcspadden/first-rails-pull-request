    "body": "### `diff` vs `deep_diff` vs `MiniTest#diff`\r\n\r\nHere is `deep_diff` usage example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{ a: { b: 1 }}.deep_diff(a: { b: 1 })        # => {}\r\n{ a: { b: 1, c: 2 } }.deep_diff(a: { b: 1 }) # => { a: { c: 2 } }\r\n{ a: { b: 1 } }.deep_diff(a: { b: 1, c: 2 }) # => { a: { c: 2 } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`diff` was introduced in @891a962a1 to improve failed assertion message. So `deep_diff` will be more useful when you need descriptive messages. So I'm wondering are there any such cases when `diff` is a better choice than `deep_diff`?\r\n\r\nAlso here is a couple of strings from Rails using `diff`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# FIXME: minitest does object diffs, do we need to have our own?\r\nmessage ||= sprintf(\"The recognized options <%s> did not match <%s>, difference: <%s>\",\r\n  request.path_parameters, expected_options, expected_options.diff(request.path_parameters))\r\nassert_equal(expected_options, request.path_parameters, message)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`FIXME` says that there is a `MiniTest` alternative which is way less descriptive:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[15] pry(main)> diff({a: 1, b: 2}, {b: 2})\r\n=> \"Expected: {:a=>1, :b=>2}\\n  Actual: {:b=>2}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo WDYT is the best way we should act here?",

Since `--dummy-path` generates the dummy app even when test unit is skipped I think it's ok to also add in the Rake tasks.\r\n\r\nI added a CHANGELOG entry and also created the `with_dummy_app?` method to reuse the condition.\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for #8121",

    "body": "Just ran into this one while working on a legacy Rails 2.3 site.\r\n\r\nTry `YAML.load(YAML.dump(t))` where `t` is an instance of `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`. Under Ruby 1.9.3, this fails with the following message:\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `period_for_utc' for nil:NilClass\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:58:in `period'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:44:in `time'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:304:in `respond_to?'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/psych/visitors/to_ruby.rb:284:in `init_with'\r\n\r\nThe solution is to backport `TimeWithZone#encode_with` from Rails 3.\r\n\r\nUnder Ruby 1.8.7, `YAML.dump` also fails, with a different message:\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: private method `gsub' called for #<StringIO:0x7f16d2215a08>\r\n\t    from ./activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:145:in `to_yaml'\r\n\r\nUnder Syck, `YAML.dump` passes a `StringIO` to `to_yaml` (rather than the \"options\" Hash which the author of `TimeWithZone#to_yaml` seemed to expect). Naturally, `gsub` fails on the `StringIO` object. The solution is simply to convert it to a String first.",

    "body": "Just ran into this one while working on a legacy Rails 2.3 site.\r\n\r\nTry `YAML.load(YAML.dump(t))` where `t` is an instance of `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`. Under Ruby 1.9.3, this fails with the following message:\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `period_for_utc' for nil:NilClass\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:58:in `period'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:44:in `time'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/Programming/Ruby/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:304:in `respond_to?'\r\n\t    from /home/alex/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/psych/visitors/to_ruby.rb:284:in `init_with'\r\n\r\nThe solution is to backport `TimeWithZone#encode_with` from Rails 3.\r\n\r\nUnder Ruby 1.8.7, `YAML.dump` also fails, with a different message:\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: private method `gsub' called for #<StringIO:0x7f16d2215a08>\r\n\t    from ./activesupport/lib/active_support/time_with_zone.rb:145:in `to_yaml'\r\n\r\nUnder Syck, `YAML.dump` passes a `StringIO` to `to_yaml` (rather than the \"options\" Hash which the author of `TimeWithZone#to_yaml` seemed to expect). Naturally, `gsub` fails on the `StringIO` object. The solution is simply to convert it to a String first.",

    "body": "In rails/strong_parameters#57, I filed a bug report:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n#### #permitted? survives :except, but not :slice\r\n\r\nI would expect that calling `:slice` on a permitted Parameters hash would return another permitted hash, just as `:except` does. But no:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> params = ActionController::Parameters.new(:foo => 42, :bar => 1337).permit(:foo, :bar)\r\n => {\"foo\"=>42, \"bar\"=>1337}\r\n> params.except(:bar).permitted?\r\n => true\r\n> params.slice(:foo).permitted?\r\n => false\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a feature, or is it a bug?\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDHH et al confirmed that it's a bug. I made a pull request rails/strong_parameters#58, which got merged in, and @rafaelfranca asked me to open a pull request for Rails core as well. Here is the description of the original pull request (with SHAs changed to match the current pull request):\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n#### Permitted should be sticky when calling slice\r\n\r\nThis pull request solves 3 different things:\r\n\r\n 1. Some of the parameters_taint tests were broken. Fixed in 5b3b9b0ebcbe35038adaf7b1636032e6f436ed1c\r\n 1. The \"permitted is sticky\" tests are actually testing that \"tainted is sticky\". \"Tainted\" seems to not be used anymore, so I changed their titles to \"not permitted is sticky\" in 93eaffe59b713e94424212540a8788f0b273f8eb – and added a test for #except in 1a0f14e0453d3a36f134989752721292aed54892\r\n 1. I made a set of new \"permitted is sticky\" tests, basically inverted copies of the existing tests, only testing on a `permitted` object: 478d80fd5788a4b3e7c8482bfd3713eef7d00884 – with the #slice bug fixed in 344364990436d9fcb7e77d5deb1beeb9c34a2b85\r\n\r\n------------",

    "body": "1) **Sign cookies using key deriver**\r\nRails will derive keys if config.secret_key_base is set instead of the old config.secret_key. If secret_key_base is not set to keep backwards compatibility Rails will not derive and just use the raw secret_key as in previous versions.\r\nUsers can change the default salt for signing cookies through config.action_dispatch.signed_cookie_salt setting which is by default 'signed cookie'.\r\n\r\n2) **cookie.encrypted method => EncryptedCookieJar**\r\nThis adds a encrypted method to CookieJar that returns a jar that'll automatically encrypt cookie values before sending them to the client and will decrypt them for read.\r\nIt also prevents from tampering by the user (or a 3rd party) throwing an ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature exception.\r\nYou must set config.secret_token_base to be able to use this feature.\r\nUsers are allowed to change the default salt used for encryption by changing config.action_dispatch.encrypted_cookie_salt which defaults to 'encrypted cookie' and can also change the salt using for signing by changing config.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt which defaults to 'signed encrypted cookie'\r\n\r\n3) **encrypted cookie store**\r\nThis adds encrypted cookie store. You now can set config.session_store :encrypted_cookie_store, key: '_myapp_session' in order to use encrypted cookies to store your session. This also makes new apps to use encrypted cookie store but default.\r\n\r\n4) **Use derive keys for http authentication**\r\nJust that it changes http authentication to use derived keys.\r\nUsers are allowed to change the default salt by changing config.action_dispatch.http_auth_salt which defaults to 'http authentication'\r\n\r\nIn general, please help me reviewing all this. Help me improving the docs for all this. And help me suggesting better names for the options, mostly …\r\n\r\nconfig.secret_key_base\r\nconfig.action_dispatch.signed_cookie_salt\r\nconfig.action_dispatch.encrypted_cookie_salt\r\nconfig.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt\r\nconfig.action_dispatch.http_auth_salt\r\n\r\n**Note to committers**: Leave this for me to merge :).\r\n\r\n/cc @NZKoz @meder @thaidn @emboss @nahi please help me reviewing giving crypto review :).",
