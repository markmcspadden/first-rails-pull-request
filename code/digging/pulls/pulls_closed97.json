I think using `DATABASE_URL` is a good idea, but the way it currently interacts with `database.yml` is pretty unintuitive. If `database.yml` is missing and `DATABASE_URL` is present, Rails blows up (no surprise there). But if both are present, `DATABASE_URL` silently wins.\r\n\r\nIt was really, really hard to figure out what was going on here, so I figured I'd spare future developers some pain. I've changed the Railtie to always use `database.yml`, but left `establish_connection` alone.",

    "body": "The `#relation` method gets called in four places and the return value was instantly cloned in three of them. The only place that did not clone was `ActiveRecord::Scoping::Default::ClassMethods#unscoped`. This introduced a bug described in #5667 and should really clone the relation, too. This means all four places would clone the relation, so it doesn't make a lot of sense caching it in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe four places with calls to relations are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nactiverecord/lib/active_record/scoping/default.rb:110:in `block in build_default_scope'\"\r\nactiverecord/lib/active_record/scoping/default.rb:42:in `unscoped'\"\r\nactiverecord/lib/active_record/scoping/named.rb:38:in `scoped'\"\r\nactiverecord/lib/active_record/scoping/named.rb:52:in `scope_attributes'\"\r\n```",

    "body": "This is syntactic sugar for case statements.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\r\n case user\r\n when ~:admin?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n when ~:active?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n if user.admin?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n elsif user.active?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n end\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the added benefit that if `user` is a method, it would only get called once, which, in certain cases, is significantly more efficient without adding complexity to the code.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe short answer is because it looks nice.\r\n\r\nActiveSupport does a great job of extending ruby with simple conveniences like `Symbol#to_proc` which has now been merged in to ruby core. I think this could be part of the sugar that makes Ruby sweeter.\r\n\r\n## Why the `~`\r\n\r\nI chose the unary method `~` because I don't see it having any other use for `Symbol`, but it could just as easily be `+` or `-`.\r\n\r\nMy original concept was to override `Symbol#===`, which allows case to be used like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncase user\r\nwhen :root?\r\n  # Do stuff\r\nwhen :active?\r\n  # Do stuff\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I felt that overriding `Symbol#===` is too obtrusive and dangerous.\r\n\r\nI wanted to use `&` as it is already accepted syntax for `Symbol#to_proc` but this is invalid ruby syntax:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncase user\r\nwhen &:active?\r\n  # Do stuff\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Negation\r\n\r\nIn offering this support I also thought about supporting negation: https://github.com/amiel/rails/compare/rails:master...case_with_predicates_and_negative\r\n\r\nThat branch allows for syntax like this as well:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n case user\r\n when ! :admin?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n when ! :active?\r\n   # Do stuff\r\n end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pull request does not support negation in this way. I didn't want to override `Symbol#!`, and I think the # 2 under *Implementation Discussions* below would be a better way to handle negation.\r\n\r\n## Implementation discussion\r\n\r\nI tried a few different implementation concepts for this. This one is by far the simplest (thanks @emmanuel for pointing me in that direction).\r\n\r\nIn ruby 1.9, procs respond to `===` for use in case (see http://www.aimred.com/news/developers/2008/08/14/unlocking_the_power_of_case_equality_proc/)\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of other options:\r\n\r\n1. My first concept was to override `Symbol#===`, which offered the nicest syntax, but I felt was too obtrusive.\r\n2. In another version, `Symbol#~` returns an object that responds to `===`, this is also concise, but not as simple as the other two options. However, it offers the most complete support for negation. Here's an example implementation that also supports negation: https://github.com/amiel/rails/compare/rails:master...case_with_predicates_with_object\r\n\r\n",
