    "body": "As described in #9127 defaults of PostgreSQL columns of array types\r\nare not extracted when the ARRAY constructor expression was used since\r\nonly the curly braces notation is expected.\r\nThis can lead to the confusing situation that new instances of\r\nactiverecord models don't prefill the relating attribute with the\r\ndefault value as usual.\r\n\r\nNonetheless it is completely valid to define a default value for a\r\ncolumn with the ARRAY constructor expression. Since it is rather\r\ncomplex to extract the default in this particular case by just scanning\r\nwith a ruby regular expression let the database itself convert from\r\nthe ARRAY constructor expression to the curly braces notation by\r\nquerying with a SELECT statement which will do the work reliable.",

    "body": "There was a lot of churn in the ParamsParser while fixing CVE-2013-0156\r\nThis attempts to restore intended functionality as faithfully as can be\r\nfrom 3957d44 for JSON and e1a0d86 for XML.\r\n\r\nAlso added is a integration test RackInputRewindTest which checks to\r\nmake sure that ParamsParser rewinds rack.input for both cases.\r\n\r\nIn some cases request.body can be [rack.input](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb#L226), so if ParamsParser doesn't rewind it unexpected things can happen. See rails#8490\r\n\r\nI encountered this trying to get the better_errors gem working in Rails 4. \r\nI've created a test app here: https://github.com/ethansr/rack_input to show [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors/blob/master/lib/better_errors/middleware.rb#L113) failing because it expects the env['rack.input'] StringIO to be at its start.\r\n\r\nIf the app is working correctly a stack trace will appear on the right side. If it isn't then a strack trace similar to this: https://gist.github.com/4591803 will appear in the logs.\r\n\r\nI realize this is sensitive file to touch right now and would appreciate any feedback.

I know the Rubyists say \"diversity is good\", but we don't need diversity like this.\r\n\r\nNow the `MissingSourceFile` constant could be removed from ActiveSupport, but I don't think we're able to do it right now, because I found several libraries referencing a constant with this name, which might be expecting ActiveSupport to define it.",

Is it fixable, or am I doing it wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[1]: Yes, this could be written more sensibly as just `author.posts`, which would avoid the subquery.  It's simplified to make a point.\r\n[2]: Again, this is a simplified version.  In my case, I've got an object which might be an AR::Base model, or it might be an AR::Relation, and I'm calling `scoped` to ensure it's definitely an `AR::Relation`.",
