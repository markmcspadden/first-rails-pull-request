    "body": "Hi,\n\nIn an earlier pull request I hoped we could decouple ActiveSupport from ActionView:\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5675\n\nIt was suggested by @josevalim that instead of that approach, we move the number helpers from ActionView to ActiveSupport.  In addition to his suggestion, this approach was a feature request in a separate issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3214\n\nIn this pull request I've moved the functionality from NumberHelper in ActionView to ActiveSupport and added the methods to Numeric.  So instead of including NumberHelper and writing \"number_to_human(123)\", you could just include ActiveSupport and write \"123.to_human\".  The original NumberHelper methods are all left in place and accept the same options and behave the same (and just pass through to the AS implementation in Numeric).\n\nOther interested parties may include: @carlosantoniodasilva, @fxn, and @yfeldblum.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any changes to this implementation.\n\nThanks,\nAndrew.\n",

I'm 99% sure that it's all good, but I've never dived into this part of Rails before.",

[Here are some quick benchmarks](https://gist.github.com/2553080). If it's necessary I can try to prepare another.\n\n@josevalim could you take a look please?\n\nAny feedback is welcome. Thanks!",

    "body": "This uses the `:en` locale as default fallback for number helpers, such as `number_with_precision` and brothers. The overall idea is that we should always have fallbacks when using such helpers, instead of letting them raise different errors due to missing arguments. The implementation basically fetches the defaults for :en and merges the translations with the given locale.\n\nAfter some discussion it seems a good path to use the default `:en` translations that ship with the framework as fallbacks instead of constants, to avoid the duplicated defaults. I'd like some feedback on this, thanks.\n\nCloses #4420, #2802, #2890.",

It looks a little bit weird to me(escaping HTML on client side). I see no single reason to send smht like this \n```\n{\"body\": \"<p>body</p>\"} \n```\n\nit's definitely not the Rails way. Anyway, it's just an option that saves JSON-backend based apps from XSS and lame code either :). ",
