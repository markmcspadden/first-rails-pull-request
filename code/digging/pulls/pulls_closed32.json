    "body": "This commit fixes a bug introduced in 96a13fc7 which breaks behaviour of\r\ninteger fields in 3.2.8.\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, setting the value of an integer field to a non-integer (eg.\r\nArray, Hash, etc.) would use the first value in the array :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n    p.category_id = { 1 => 2 }\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.9 and above, this will raise a NoMethodError :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.9\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `to_i' for [1, 2]:Array\r\n\r\nWhilst at first blush this appear to be sensible, it combines in bad\r\nways with scoping.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is common to use scopes to control access to data :\r\n\r\n    @collection = Posts.where(:category_id => [ 1,2 ])\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, this would work as expected, creating a new Post object\r\n(albeit with `@new_post.category_id = 1`). However, in 3.2.9 this will\r\ncause the NoMethodError to be raised as above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to avoid triggering this error without descoping before\r\ncalling `.new`, breaking any apps running on 3.2.8 that rely on this\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThis patch deviates from 3.2.8 in that it does not retain the somewhat\r\nspurious behaviour of setting the attribute to the first element or key.\r\nInstead, it explicitly sets these invalid values to nil :\r\n\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the situation where a scope using an array will\r\n\"pollute\" any newly instantiated records.\r\n\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n    @new_post.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nFinally, 3.2.8 exhibited a behaviour where setting an object to an\r\ninteger field caused it to be coerced to \"1\". This has not been\r\nretained, as it is spurious and surprising in the same way that setting\r\nArrays and Hashes was :\r\n\r\n    c = Category.find(6)\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\n    # This patch\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => nil",

    "body": "This allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for `ActionController`:\r\n\r\n    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter\r\n\r\nPreviously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks in `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object filter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on `@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`. So, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to remove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter object and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.",
