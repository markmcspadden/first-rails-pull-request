    "body": "Rails escapes HTML entities in erb files. This is great, because it prevents Cross Site Scripting and other evil attacks. However there is one case, where this behavior leads to undesired effects.\n\nRails escapes HTML entities in plain text mails. When I am using a `message.text.erb` file, `ActionMailer` correctly detects that the mail contains plain text and sets a `text/plain` mime type. However, ERB still handles this as an html file and escapes HTML entities.\n\nFor example, if my template contains `Dear <%= @customer_name %>, ...` and `@customer_name` is *Foobar & Partner*, then the mail will contain *Dear Foobar <b>&amp;amp;</b> Partner*.\n\nThe following commit just disables HTML escaping in text templates. A text erb template is every file that has `.text` in the file name and is handled by erb.\n",

I only realised when I upgraded Rails to the latest 3-2 version and it broke my app. I'd been using a patched version locally. My fail. \n\nThe files that were updated on master haven't changed on 3-2-stable, so it should be very straightforward.\n\nThanks,\niHiD",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI refactored a piece of the `ActiveModel::Naming` module. In the part of the code that tries to find the `model_name` for the passed argument, I changed the implementation from \"type based\" (checking for Class) to \"behavior based\" (checking for method)\n\nThis change behaves almost 100% the same as the previous implementation.\n\n* Makes the same assumptions as old code. If argument responds to `to_model`, then `.to_model.class.model_name` can be called.\n* If argument it is not a `Class`, call `.class.model_name`\n* This version however allows the argument to directly respond to `model_name` if it can.\n\nThis gives a (very minor) speed boost if a class is passed, but more importantly; it allows an instance to define its \"name\". \n\nWe use one class to store most of our data. However, how this class should behave, depends on it's configuration. Routing, human names, partials all depend on this configuration. By allowing the instance to respond to model_name, we can easily take advantage of all `ActiveModel` based code.",

    "body": "Reversible migrations are very cool.\n\nSome commands are not reversible, for example the removal of a table or a column.\n\nAlso, one downside is that it is now more difficult to write the reverse of a migration if `change` is used. When `up` and `down` were used, one could simply swap the code around.\n\nThese commits introduce `Migration#revert` that makes it trivial to revert a past migration, in part or in whole, or do a reversible removal of a table/column.\n\nNote that `revert` can even be called from legacy migrations using `up` & `down` and that it can revert legacy-style migrations too. For anyone changing their mind every second day, `revert` is fully nestable.\n\nTo have complete revertible capability, I would like to introduce a modified syntax for `change_column` that would allow it to be revertible; pull request upcoming when I get a chance...\n\nHere's what the rdoc looks like:\n\n---\n\nReverses the migration commands for the given block and the given migrations.\n\nThe following migration will remove the table 'horses' and create the table 'apples' on the way up, and the reverse on the way down.\n\n    class FixTLMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def change\n        revert do\n          create_table(:horses) do |t|\n            t.text :content\n            t.datetime :remind_at\n          end\n        end\n        create_table(:apples) do |t|\n          t.string :variety\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nOr equivalently, if `TenderloveMigration` is defined as in the\ndocumentation for Migration:\n\n    class FixupTLMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def change\n        revert TenderloveMigration\n\n        create_table(:apples) do |t|\n          t.string :variety\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nThis command can be nested.\n",

It does this by looking up the correct foreign key on the association, and changing the column to use that key when appropriate. It came out of a discussion in issue #1736 that seemed to have some interest.\n\nThe following queries are now equivalent:\n\n```ruby\nPost.where(:author_id => Author.first)\nPost.where(:author => Author.first)\n```\n\nI also think it makes it more consistent with `has_many` queries where the relationship and query key are both plural:\n\n```ruby\nposts = Post.containing_the_letter_a.limit(5)\nAuthor.where(:posts => posts)\n```",
