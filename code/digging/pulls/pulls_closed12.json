Likely they wanted to define a host `host: \"example.com\"` and a `protocol: \"http://\"` but did not know the convention.\r\n\r\nThis may not the most common problem, but when it happens it can go undetected for a while. I accidentally added `http://` out of habit recently only to find all the links in my emails were broken after deploying a demo site to production. Rather than allow this accident go undetected, we can fix the problem in line by properly setting the protocol and host.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was able to find this related question on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5878329/rails-3-devise-how-do-i-make-the-email-confirmation-links-use-secure-https-n where the answer was highly upvoted.\r\n\r\nThis is based off of work in #7415 cc/ @pixeltrix\r\n\r\nATP Action Mailer and Action Pack",
