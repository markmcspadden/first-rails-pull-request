    "body": "This addresses the primary problem in issue #5670 by using request.GET and request.POST instead of request.params.\r\n\r\nActionDispatch::Http::Parameters#parameters (same as request.params) depends on ActionDispatch::ParamsParser middleware to properly assign env[\"action_dispatch.request.request_parameters\"], but will assign that itself in a more naive way if it has not been set yet by ParamsParser. It uses this value (env[\"action_dispatch.request.request_parameters\"]) to permanently (||=) set the consolidated parameters in env[\"action_dispatch.request.parameters\"].\r\n\r\nIf request.params is called BEFORE ParamsParser (e.g. in session middleware), then env[\"action_dispatch.request.parameters\"] will be assigned permanently based on a more naive env[\"action_dispatch.request.request_parameters\"] from ActionDispatch::Http::Parameters#parameters. ParamsParser will still reassign env[\"action_dispatch.request.request_parameters\"] when it runs, but env[\"action_dispatch.request.parameters\"] will have already been assigned and will not be recalculated.\r\n\r\nIf request.params is called AFTER ParamsParser (i.e. it is NOT called by session middleware), then env[\"action_dispatch.request.parameters\"] will be assigned based on ParamsParser env[\"action_dispatch.request.request_parameters\"].\r\n\r\nThus, depending on whether session middleware calls ActionDispatch::Session::AbstractStore#extract_session_id with no cookie set AND cookies_only set to false, the params could be set incorrectly. This bug seems unusual, since not that many people use the cookies_only feature and the feature is only effective if no cookie is already set.\r\n\r\n",

It works for me but it surely not expected behavior for RAILS_ENV=some_not_named_test_environment_for_tests rake test.\r\nThanks,\r\nAlexander at alexandr.kostrikov@gmail.com",

But in case of read_attribute, when reading the `id` [it was not being typecasted after the change](http://travis-ci.org/#!/rails/rails/jobs/978068/L111).\r\n\r\nAlso added a deprecation message to `type_cast_code` according to the conversation in the same commit.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
