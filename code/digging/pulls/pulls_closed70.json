    "body": "This was requested by @wycats in Rails-core mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-core/MhbmIeHBURU/EiXenlob1okJ)\n\n```\nactivemodel is used for ActiveModel::Naming for a few, mostly optional aspects of ActionPack related to automatically converting an ActiveModel compliant object into a key for params and routing. It uses only two methods of ActiveModel (ActiveModel::Naming.route_key and ActiveModel::Naming.param_key). I think we should remove this dependency, as the point of the ActiveModel API refactor in Rails 3 was to allow *any* object to work in AP. Additionally, only a few areas of the code use even the ActiveModel API.\n```",

I've basically cleaned up some code, and moved the *instantiation* code to a `MultiparameterAttribute` class to avoid passing arguments here and there.\n\nI'm opening as a pull request now to ask for some feedback/review, and to allow inline comments if necessary. In case it's ok I plan to merge and continue the work later.\n\nAny feedback is welcome, thanks!",

The names being out of sync complicates things when multiple DB users are used in production (e.g. one user for migrations and one user for app connections) and permissions need to be applied to tables and their associated sequences.\n\nAttached is proposed crazy sauce which renames the primary key sequence if its name matches the default PK sequence created by the adapter.",

    "body": "The current implementation on Rails is not capable of handling an object with time only, it only allows you to create an object with both time and date, which isn't really nice as you can create a time only column in almost all database systems.\n\nThis fix adds support for time only object creation (if the column is created as :time) by using Ruby's Time object. The date fields will default to \"January 1, 1970\" since Ruby doesn't have an object for time only. Implementation also includes specs showing what's the correct behavior and also a failure if you try to create a time only object of a column of type datetime.\n\nThis pull request fixes issue #6825.",

    "body": "#### WHAT\n\nAvoid creating many throwaway `String` and `Regexp` objects while using ActiveSupport's inflections.\n\n#### WHY\n\nBoth the `pluralize` and `singularize` methods are widely used in Rails (`AssetTagHelper` is a good example). They both call `apply_inflections`, which first tries to match against every `uncountables`, cycling thru and creating a new `Regexp` and `String` for each `uncountable`.  \n\n#### HOW\n\nThis patch seemed to be the simplest solution to caching `uncountable` regexp's that I could write. Here is the memprof and benchmark before the patch (w/1.8.7 REE):\n\n```\nMemprof.track { 1000.times { \"hey\".pluralize } }\n   9000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:312:String\n   9000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:312:Regexp\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:315:__unknown__\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:315:String\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:315:MatchData\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:312:__node__\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:310:String\n   1000 (irb):1:String\n      1 (irb):1:__varmap__\n\nBenchmark.ms { 1000.times { \"hey\".pluralize } }\n => 100.382089614868 \n```\n\nAnd after the patch:\n\n```\nMemprof.track { 1000.times { \"hey\".pluralize } }\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:318:__unknown__\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:318:String\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:318:MatchData\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:315:__node__\n   1000 /.../activesupport-3.2.6/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb:313:String\n   1000 (irb):3:String\n      1 (irb):3:__varmap__\n\nBenchmark.ms { 1000.times { \"hey\".pluralize } }\n => 51.4700412750244 \n```\n\n",
