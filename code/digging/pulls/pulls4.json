    "body": "This PR is only meant as a discussion point at this time.  I do not\r\ncurrently have a fix here.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a problem when using optimistic locking with\r\n:dependent => :destroy and :touch => true.  This pull request\r\nattempts to expose the error although I do not yet have a\r\nfix.  Please see the new test in locking_test and note that\r\nit fails.  This failure means that when attempting to destroy\r\na model object with :dependent => :destroy on a realtionship\r\nwhere the inverse has :touch => true results in:\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::StaleObjectError: Attempted to destroy a stale object\r\n\r\nIf in the new test we attempted to do `p.destroy` we would trigger the\r\nStaleObjectError.  This is because the lock_version of the Person in\r\nthe database gets updated when the :reference is destroyed due to\r\n:touch => true but the in-memory lock_version on the person object,\r\np, is NOT updated so when the destroy is attempted it thinks it is\r\nstale.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to fix this in AR without breaking anything else\r\nwould be appreciated.",

It removes punctuation, replaces\r\n    e.g :: with /, _ with ' ', etc.\r\n\r\nOne doubt I have is whether \"MAN WITHOUT A PAST\" should be titlecased to \"Man Without A Past\" or should be left as it is. I lean to the first version (transforming it) but wanted to hear some feedback first. It is not yet implemented so it should be an extra commit.",

However, his solution is not quite correct because there are some edge cases which cause his solution to fail (in particular, uniqueness validations with scopes).\r\n\r\n## The Problem:\r\n\r\nThe reason why this had to be solved with a bunch of code is because (at least to my knowledge) there's currently no way to check the uniqueness of a collection of new objects that have not yet been saved. \r\n\r\nThe basic problem is that we have a bunch of new objects in our association, so when we check to see if they are valid one by one, each of the uniqueness validations pass. However, if two objects in the collection should fail a uniqueness validation (maybe two objects in the collection are exactly the same) we'd never know. We need to introduce some way to validate uniqueness across an unpersisted collection of records.\r\n\r\n## My Solution:\r\n\r\nMy solution is to add a new method which checks uniqueness in a collection which has not yet been persisted. This only is called after all of the other validations are run and have passed (thus it is only called if records have not yet been persisted). \r\n\r\nI found all of the uniqueness validations associated with a particular collection of records, then made sure that the collection of records doesn't break any of these uniqueness validators.",

    "body": "If a record that does not belong to a HABTM collection is passed in to a collection to be deleted, the after_remove callback is run even though the record was not actually removed. This can cause unexpected behaviour, such as incorrectly decrementing a counter.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour still has before_remove called, but after_remove called only if the record was actually removed from the collection.\r\n\r\nExample of unexpected behaviour:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :post_collections\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass PostCollection < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :posts, after_remove: :decrememnt_posts_count\r\n\r\n  def decrement_posts_count\r\n     PostCollection.decrement_counter :posts_count, self.id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\npost = Post.new\r\npost_collection = PostCollection.new\r\npost_collection.posts.delete(post)\r\n\r\n# post_collection.posts_count is now -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\nThe pull request fixes behaviour that may or may not have been what was originally intended. If after_remove is to be called regardless of what happens to the data, this will invalidate the pull request. It seems intuitive however that the after_remove callback should only be run if the record was actually removed from the collection.\r\n",

Fix the bug: I attached a pull request with a failing test and bugfix\r\n2. Revert https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3438 .

This is because a step in the fixture load process does not reference the prefixed table, but the table without a prefix. This causes silent database errors, which in turn fails to load the fixtures in the transaction, which means that tested apps get a weird \"Cannot find where id=?\".\r\n\r\nThis looks like it was fixed in the master branch (along with others), but this patch provides a basic update that fixes this particular error for 3.2.",

    "body": "this fix issue #8931.\r\n\r\nWhen you add one callack in two separate `set_callback` calls - it is\r\nonly called once.\r\n\r\nWhen you do it in one `set_callback` call - it is called twice.\r\n\r\nThis violates the principle of least astonishment for me. Duplicating\r\ncallback is usually an error. There is a correct and obvious way to do\r\nanything without this \"feature\".\r\n\r\nIf you want to do\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    before_save :clear_balance, :calculate_tax, :clear_balance\r\n```\r\n\r\nor whatever, you should better do\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    before_save :carefully_calculate_tax\r\n\r\n    def carefully_calculate_tax\r\n      clear_balance\r\n      calculate_tax\r\n      clear_balance\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this even opens gates for some advanced refactorings, unlike the\r\nfirst approach.\r\n\r\nMy assumptions are:\r\n\r\n- Principle of least astonishment is violated, when callbacks are either\r\n  prevented from duplication, or not.\r\n- Duplicating callbacks is usually an error. When it is intentional -\r\n  it's a smell of a bad design and can be approached without abusing\r\n  this \"feature\".\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is: do not allow duplicating callbacks in one callback\r\ncall, like it is not allowed in separate callbacks call.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n\tactivesupport/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\tactivesupport/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb\r\n\tactivesupport/test/callbacks_test.rb",
