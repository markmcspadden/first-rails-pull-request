    "body": "I'm working on a Liquid style templating system, and would like to take advantage of Action View's template digestor. However, there are no direct calls to `render` from within the template itself, but rather in an accompanying \"presenter\"/\"view model\"/whatever. Therefore, the approach currently taken by Digestor falls short of tracking the dependencies. Furthermore, since these templates would be user-supplied, I would rather avoid having to put in explicit dependency markers in the source itself, instead preferring to let the presenters do that.\r\n\r\nI've refactored Digestor so that it is possible to register a custom dependency tracker. I'm not sure if the nomenclature is perfect, so I'm of course open for suggestions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the tracker is chosen based on the template handler, which should roughly correspond to the template language. I'd like a better way of looking up trackers, e.g. by having each Template know its \"language\". That would be a bigger change than seems necessary right now, though.\r\n\r\nAnother question is whether the dependency tracker should default to the ErbTracker, which perhaps should be renamed. I'm not sure what level of support there is for non-Erb templating languages in Digestor right now.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at this, I'd really love to be able to work with the new digest code :-)\r\n\r\nAlso: I've made a pull request to cache_digests that matches this one: rails/cache_digests#19.",

This changes first checks, if the partial actually was rendered and raises a descriptive error.\r\n\r\n### 2. recognize partial inside a directory\r\n\r\npreviously when a partial was placed inside a directory (eg. '/dir/_partial'), `assert_template` did not replace the '_' prefix when looking through rendered tempaltes, which resulted in an error.\r\n    \r\nI modified it to replace both, the leading '_' and the last '_' after a '/'.\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for #8516",

    "body": "**I don't expect this to be insta-merged - discussion, code review and suggestions are welcome.**\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there are heaps of non thread safe usage of Hashes in Rails and the surrounding gems. This needs to be fixed. Instead of littering the whole code base with the `synchronize {}` blocks, it is better done by creating a fully thread-safe hash-like data structure.\r\n\r\nThis is where `ThreadSafe::Cache` comes in. It is:\r\n * a thread-safe hash-like data structure\r\n * reads are lock-free\r\n * writes might be using locks, but this is fixable in the future\r\n * storing an item in `Cache` constitutes safe publication\r\n * reads have volatile semantics (allows for properly done double-checked locking idiom)\r\n * writes have volatile semantics\r\n\r\nImplementation details are as follows:\r\n * on MRI 1.8/1.9/2.0 it is a [thin wrapper](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe/blob/master/lib/thread_safe/non_concurrent_cache_backend.rb) around a `Hash` class that [mostly](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe/blob/master/lib/thread_safe/mri_cache_backend.rb) relies on GIL for protection\r\n * on JRuby it uses native [Java `ConcurrentHashMap`](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe/blob/master/ext/org/jruby/ext/thread_safe/JRubyCacheBackendLibrary.java)\r\n * on Rubinius it uses a [pure Ruby](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe/blob/master/lib/thread_safe/atomic_reference_cache_backend.rb) port of Doug Lea's new JDK8 `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`\r\n * everywhere else it defaults to a [fully synchronized](https://github.com/headius/thread_safe/blob/master/lib/thread_safe/synchronized_cache_backend.rb) `Hash` wrapper\r\n\r\nWhy is it better than explicit synchronisation?\r\n\r\nA thread-safe hash is a very useful abstraction, it simplifies the code and allows to avoid worrying about thread-safety most of the time. Explicit locking is not so easily done and is prone to missing some code paths. As the amount of explicit locks increases, so does the probability of deadlocks. Locks are slightly slower than lock-free volatile reads and scale horribly as the concurrency level increases.\r\n\r\nPrevious pull request: #6917.",

    "body": "By formatting routes for different media (txt/html) we can apply optimizations based on the format. We can include meta-data in the HTML to allow a rich experience while rendering and viewing the routes. This PR shows route helpers as they are used with the `_path` extension, it also has a javascript toggle on the top to switch to `_url`. This way the developer can see the exact named route helper they can use instead of having to modify a base. \r\n\r\nThis is one example of an optimization that could be applied. Eventually we can link out to guides for the different columns to better explain what helper, HTTP Verb, Path, and Controller#action indicate. We could even add a route search box that could allow developers to input a given route and see all of the routes that match it. These are stand alone features and should be delivered separately.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3A2p3c1T1t2f2X2R2K2S/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-12%20at%202.28.01%20PM.png)",

    "body": "Was unable to use `database_cleaner` in CI environment without this change. Right now Rails 3.2.9 and master both just try to disable all triggers including the RI_ConstraintTriggers which it cannot, then it tries to enable the RI_ConstraintTriggers in the ensure, which also fails. With this change it will have more executes in the disabling while it attempts to disable trigger all, falling back to disable trigger user, and then will only undo what it did if it fails. Just as it was before, this will still enable disabled triggers that could be checked via the pg_trigger table, but that is a much more difficult problem, and this solution works in the originally intended manner, albeit with more executes that could slow it down. The alternative would be to use pg_trigger table to find out what triggers can and need to be disabled, but that is also more complex, so the nasty catch-the-error method is an interim workaround for simplicity.",

Since `@env['RAW_POST_DATA']` has already been set, the result of `#body` is not `@env['rack.input']` anymore. \r\n\r\nThis causes `@env['rack.input']` to never be rewound.\r\n\r\nThis is also an issue in 3.2 and earlier versions of Rails.",
