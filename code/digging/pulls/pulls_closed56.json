I'd like to use capture(:stderr) but it's not impossible because it doesn't reopen $std{out,err} and just reassigns it, that does impossible to capture subprocesses.\n",

    "body": "Using the canonical blog example, given an isolated/mounted engine within a module `Blog`, the current behaviour of the mounted URL helpers is to create a method `blog` which sets an instance variable `@blog`.\n\nThis effectively prevents the instance variable `@blog` from being usable anywhere else within the application where we also want to refer to the blog engine's routes. For example the home page controller action will raise an error if we assign the `@blog` ivar and then try to refer to `blog.post_path(@blog)`.\n\nThe straight-forward fix for this is to name the instance variable for the mounted helpers using internal naming conventions, in this case `@_blog`.",

Every adapter should define it's own column mappings and not delegate to a global superclass, which has some knowledge of the different database vendors.\n\nThis make the mappings simpler because we just need to care about the datatypes of one vendor and it allows us to issue warnings when unsupported datatypes are detected.",
